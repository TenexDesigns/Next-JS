A typical Next.js project structure includes several key files and folders, each with a specific function. Heres what each file or folder does:


  /.next/: This is a generated directory where Next.js stores its build output, including static HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and images. This folder should not be versioned with your source code stackoverflow.com.

  /components/: This folder typically contains reusable React components, which can be imported into multiple pages or other components stackoverflow.com.

  /pages/: This is a special directory where Next.js looks for files to set up routing for the application. Each file in this directory corresponds to a route in the application. Special files like _app.js(x) and _document.js(x) are used to customize default document and application templates stackoverflow.com, nextjs.org.

  /public/: This directory is used to serve static files. Any files placed in this directory will be mapped to the / root path stackoverflow.com, nextjs.org.

  /contexts/, /providers/: These folders are often used to manage global state or context in a Next.js application using Reacts Context API stackoverflow.com.

  /redux/: If youre using Redux for state management, this directory would typically contain your Redux store, actions, and reducers stackoverflow.com.

  /shared/: This folder is often used to store shared utilities, constants, or styles that are used across the application stackoverflow.com.

  /widgets/: This directory is often used to store complex components that might be used across multiple pages or components stackoverflow.com.

  Root level files: At the root of the directory, there are a few configuration and setup files such as .eslintrc (ESLint configuration), .env (environment variables), babel.config.js (Babel configuration), jest.config.js (Jest configuration), next.config.js (Next.js configuration), package.json (project dependencies and scripts), and README.md (project documentation) stackoverflow.com, medium.com.

  Remember, this structure can be adjusted to best suit your projects needs. The key is to keep the structure organized and understandable for anyone working on the project.

In a Next.js project, the file and folder structure can vary depending on the specific needs of the project. However, there are some common files and folders that you will typically find in a Next.js project. Here's a general overview of the main files and folders and their purposes:

/pages: This folder is where you define your applications pages. Each JavaScript or TypeScript file in this folder represents a different page of your application. For example, index.js or index.tsx represents the homepage, about.js or about.tsx represents the about page, and so on.

/public: This folder is used to store static assets like images, fonts, or any other files that need to be publicly accessible. You can reference these assets directly in your code using relative URLs.

/components: This folder is used to store reusable React components that are used across multiple pages or sections of your application. It helps in organizing and reusing code.

/styles: This folder can be used to store CSS or other styling-related files for your components or pages. You can use CSS modules or any other CSS-in-JS libraries for styling your components.

next.config.js: This file is used to configure Next.js behavior and plugins. You can specify various configurations such as customizing webpack, setting environment variables, configuring routing, and more.

package.json: This file lists the dependencies and scripts for your project. It contains information about your project and its dependencies, and you can use npm or yarn commands to install dependencies and run scripts.

tsconfig.json (optional): If you are using TypeScript in your Next.js project, this file is used to configure TypeScript compiler options.

Other files: Depending on your project, you may have additional files such as .gitignore for version control, .env for environment variables, or configuration files for tools like ESLint or Prettier.

Its important to note that this is a general overview, and the structure may vary based on your specific project requirements and preferences. You can organize your files and folders in a way that makes sense for your application's architecture and needs.
