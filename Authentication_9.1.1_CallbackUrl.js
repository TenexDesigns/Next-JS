Sure, the callbackUrl is a parameter that can be used to specify a URL to redirect the user to after they have been authenticated.

In the context of your code, the callbackUrl is appended as a query parameter to the destination URL in the redirect object. If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to the destination URL, which is the sign-in page. After they sign in, they are then redirected to the callbackUrl.

Heres your modified code:

import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth/react'

function Blog({data}) {
  return (
    <div>Blog Pages - {data}</div>
  )
}

export default Blog

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const session = await getServerSession(context.req)

  if (!session) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/api/auth/signin?callbackUrl=http://localhost:3000/blog',
        permanent: false,
      },
    }
  }

  const data = 'List of 100 blogs available to signed in users'

  return {
    props: {
        data
    }
  }
}
In this case, if the user is not signed in, they are redirected to /api/auth/signin, which is the sign-in page. The callbackUrl is http://localhost:3000/blog, so after the user signs in, they are redirected to this URL stackoverflow.com.

Remember to implement the sign-in logic on the /api/auth/signin page to handle the callbackUrl. You could extract the callbackUrl from the query parameters and pass it to the signIn function:

import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react'

export default function SignIn() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { callbackUrl } = router.query

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    signIn('your-provider-name', { callbackUrl })
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Your sign-in form here */}
    </form>
  )
}
In this code, useRouter is used to access the query parameters of the current URL. The callbackUrl is extracted from the query parameters and passed to the signIn function. After the user signs in, they are redirected to the callbackUrl stackoverflow.com.

  Certainly! The code you provided demonstrates the usage of the callbackUrl concept in the context of server-side authentication using NextAuth.js. Here's an updated version of the code with an explanation:

jsx
Copy code
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth/react';

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const session = await getServerSession(context.req);

  if (!session) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: 'google/signin?callbackUrl=http://localhost:3000/blog',
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }

  // Continue with your server-side logic here

  return {
    props: {},
  };
}
In the updated code:

The getServerSideProps function remains the same for fetching the session using getServerSession.

If the session doesn't exist (i.e., the user is not signed in), we return a redirect object. The destination property specifies the URL to which the user will be redirected. In this case, the destination is set to 'google/signin' with a callbackUrl query parameter appended to it. The callbackUrl parameter contains the URL http://localhost:3000/blog, which represents the URL of the page the user will be redirected back to after successful authentication.

The permanent property is set to false, indicating that the redirection is temporary. This corresponds to an HTTP status code of 307 (Temporary Redirect).

This code snippet showcases the concept of a callback URL in the context of authentication. When the user is not signed in, they will be redirected to the specified sign-in page ('google/signin' in this case), with the callbackUrl parameter containing the URL of the page they originally intended to visit (http://localhost:3000/blog in this example). After successful authentication, the user will be redirected back to the provided callback URL.

Please note that the 'google/signin' URL is just a placeholder, and you would need to replace it with the actual sign-in URL of your authentication provider. Similarly, you can modify the callbackUrl value to match your desired page or route in your Next.js application.
