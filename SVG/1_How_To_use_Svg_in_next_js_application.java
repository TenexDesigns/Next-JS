There are two main ways to use SVG in a Next.js app:

1. **Use the `Image` component.** The `Image` component is a built-in Next.js component that can be used to render images, including SVGs. To use the `Image` component to render an SVG, simply pass the path to the SVG file to the `src` prop. For example, the following code would render the SVG file `logo.svg` from the `/public` directory:

```js
import Image from 'next/image';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Image src="/public/logo.svg" alt="My logo" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

2. **Use the `svg` element.** You can also use the standard `svg` element to render SVGs in Next.js. To do this, simply copy and paste the contents of the SVG file into your Next.js page or component. For example, the following code would render the contents of the `logo.svg` file:

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="red" />
      </svg>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Which method you choose to use depends on your specific needs. If you need to render an SVG image, the `Image` component is the best option. If you need to render an SVG inline, such as in a React component, the `svg` element is the best option.

Here are some additional tips for using SVG in Next.js:

* **Use the `public` directory for SVG images.** If you are using the `Image` component to render SVG images, it is best to place the SVG files in the `/public` directory. This will ensure that the images are optimized for performance and that they are served correctly.
* **Use the `next/font` package to load SVG fonts.** If you are using SVG fonts, you can use the `next/font` package to load them in your Next.js app. This will ensure that the fonts are loaded correctly and that they are optimized for performance.
* **Use Tailwind CSS to style SVGs.** You can use Tailwind CSS to style SVGs in the same way that you would style any other element. For example, you can use the `fill` and `stroke` utility classes to change the fill and stroke colors of an SVG.

I hope this helps!
