In Tailwind CSS, functions and directives are tools that help you customize and extend the framework's utility classes and styles. Let's explore the key functions and directives mentioned in your provided documentation:

**Directives:**

1. **@tailwind:**
   - This directive allows you to include Tailwind's base, components, utilities, and variants styles into your CSS.
   - It provides control over where Tailwind injects classes like hover, focus, responsive, and dark mode variants.
   - You can use it to organize your CSS with respect to Tailwind's layers: base, components, and utilities.

2. **@layer:**
   - The @layer directive is used to categorize and organize your custom styles within specific layers, such as base, components, or utilities.
   - Any custom CSS added to a layer is only included in the final build if it is used in your HTML.
   - You can use modifiers (e.g., hover:, focus:) and responsive modifiers (e.g., md:, lg:) within @layer to conditionally apply styles.

3. **@apply:**
   - The @apply directive allows you to inline existing utility classes into your custom CSS.
   - This is useful when you need to write custom CSS but still want to work with Tailwind's design tokens and syntax.
   - It removes the !important flag by default, but you can make it !important if needed.

4. **@config:**
   - Use the @config directive to specify which Tailwind configuration file to use when compiling a particular CSS file.
   - This is helpful for projects that need different configuration files for different CSS entry points.

**Functions:**

1. **theme():**
   - The theme() function allows you to access Tailwind's configuration values using dot notation.
   - You can access values related to colors, spacing, typography, breakpoints, and more.
   - If you need to access a value that contains a dot (e.g., spacing[2.5]), you can use square bracket notation.
   - To adjust the opacity of a color retrieved with theme, use a slash followed by the opacity value.

2. **screen():**
   - The screen() function helps you create media queries that reference your breakpoints by name rather than duplicating their values in your CSS.
   - This simplifies the creation of responsive styles, as it resolves to the underlying screen value at build-time.

These functions and directives provide you with the flexibility to customize and extend Tailwind CSS to suit your project's specific needs. They allow you to work with design tokens, organize your styles, and create responsive designs more efficiently.

Functions & Directives
A reference for the custom functions and directives Tailwind exposes to your CSS.

​
Directives
Directives are custom Tailwind-specific at-rules you can use in your CSS that offer special functionality for Tailwind CSS projects.

​
@tailwind
Use the @tailwind directive to insert Tailwind’s base, components, utilities and variants styles into your CSS.

/**
 * This injects Tailwind's base styles and any base styles registered by
 * plugins.
 */
@tailwind base;

/**
 * This injects Tailwind's component classes and any component classes
 * registered by plugins.
 */
@tailwind components;

/**
 * This injects Tailwind's utility classes and any utility classes registered
 * by plugins.
 */
@tailwind utilities;

/**
 * Use this directive to control where Tailwind injects the hover, focus,
 * responsive, dark mode, and other variants of each class.
 *
 * If omitted, Tailwind will append these classes to the very end of
 * your stylesheet by default.
 */
@tailwind variants;
​
@layer
Use the @layer directive to tell Tailwind which “bucket” a set of custom styles belong to. Valid layers are base, components, and utilities.

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply text-2xl;
  }
  h2 {
    @apply text-xl;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .btn-blue {
    @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
}

@layer utilities {
  .filter-none {
    filter: none;
  }
  .filter-grayscale {
    filter: grayscale(100%);
  }
}
Tailwind will automatically move the CSS within any @layer directive to the same place as the corresponding @tailwind rule, so you don’t have to worry about authoring your CSS in a specific order to avoid specificity issues.

Any custom CSS added to a layer will only be included in the final build if that CSS is actually used in your HTML, just like all of the classes built in to Tailwind by default.

Wrapping any custom CSS with @layer also makes it possible to use modifiers with those rules, like hover: and focus: or responsive modifiers like md: and lg:.

​
@apply
Use @apply to inline any existing utility classes into your own custom CSS.

This is useful when you need to write custom CSS (like to override the styles in a third-party library) but still want to work with your design tokens and use the same syntax you’re used to using in your HTML.

.select2-dropdown {
  @apply rounded-b-lg shadow-md;
}
.select2-search {
  @apply border border-gray-300 rounded;
}
.select2-results__group {
  @apply text-lg font-bold text-gray-900;
}
Any rules inlined with @apply will have !important removed by default to avoid specificity issues:

/* Input */
.foo {
  color: blue !important;
}

.bar {
  @apply foo;
}

/* Output */
.foo {
  color: blue !important;
}

.bar {
  color: blue;
}
If you’d like to @apply an existing class and make it !important, simply add !important to the end of the declaration:

/* Input */
.btn {
  @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded !important;
}

/* Output */
.btn {
  font-weight: 700 !important;
  padding-top: .5rem !important;
  padding-bottom: .5rem !important;
  padding-right: 1rem !important;
  padding-left: 1rem !important;
  border-radius: .25rem !important;
}
Note that if you’re using Sass/SCSS, you’ll need to use Sass’ interpolation feature to get this to work:

.btn {
  @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded #{!important};
}
​
Using @apply with per-component CSS
Component frameworks like Vue and Svelte support adding per-component styles within a <style> block that lives in each component file.

If you try to @apply a custom class you’ve defined in your global CSS in one of these per-component <style> blocks, you’ll get an error about the class not existing:

main.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .card {
    background-color: theme(colors.white);
    border-radius: theme(borderRadius.lg);
    padding: theme(spacing.6);
    box-shadow: theme(boxShadow.xl);
  }
}
Card.svelte
<div>
  <slot></slot>
</div>

<style>
  div {
    /* Won't work because this file and main.css are processed separately */
    @apply card;
  }
</style>
This is because under-the-hood, frameworks like Vue and Svelte are processing every single <style> block independently, and running your PostCSS plugin chain against each one in isolation.

That means if you have 10 components that each have a <style> block, Tailwind is being run 10 separate times, and each run has zero knowledge about the other runs. Because of this, when you try to @apply card in Card.svelte it fails, because Tailwind has no idea that the card class exists since Svelte processed Card.svelte and main.css in total isolation from each other.

The solution to this problem is to define any custom styles you want to @apply in your components using the plugin system instead:

tailwind.config.js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ addComponents, theme }) {
      addComponents({
        '.card': {
          backgroundColor: theme('colors.white'),
          borderRadius: theme('borderRadius.lg'),
          padding: theme('spacing.6'),
          boxShadow: theme('boxShadow.xl'),
        }
      })
    })
  ]
}
This way any file processed by Tailwind that uses this config file will have access to those styles.

Honestly though the best solution is to just not do weird stuff like this at all. Use Tailwind’s utilities directly in your markup the way they are intended to be used, and don’t abuse the @apply feature to do things like this and you will have a much better experience.

​
@config
Use the @config directive to specify which config file Tailwind should use when compiling that CSS file. This is useful for projects that need to use different configuration files for different CSS entry points.


site.css

admin.css
@config "./tailwind.site.config.
