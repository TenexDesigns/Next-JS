To center the content both horizontally and vertically within the `<div>`, you can use Flexbox or Grid in Tailwind CSS. Here's how to do it using Flexbox classes:

```jsx
<div className="h-10 w-10 flex items-center justify-center">
  22
</div>
```

In the code above:

- `h-10` and `w-10` set the height and width of the `<div>`.
- `flex` applies Flexbox to the `<div>`.
- `items-center` centers the content vertically within the `<div>`.
- `justify-center` centers the content horizontally within the `<div>`.

With these classes, the "22" content will be centered both horizontally and vertically within the `<div>`.
