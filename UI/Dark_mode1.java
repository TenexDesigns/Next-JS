Tailwind CSS provides a built-in way to style your site differently when dark mode is enabled using the `dark` variant. Here is how you can use it in your Next.js project:

1. First, enable dark mode in your `tailwind.config.js` file. You can use the `media` strategy (default) which uses system settings, or the `class` strategy which allows manual toggling of dark mode:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     darkMode: 'class', // or 'media'
     // ...
   };
   ```

2. Then, you can use the `dark:{class}` syntax to apply styles when dark mode is enabled. For example, you can have a white background in light mode and a black background in dark mode:

   ```jsx
   <div className="bg-white dark:bg-black">
     {/* Content */}
   </div>
   ```

   In this example, the `bg-white` class applies in light mode, and the `dark:bg-black` class applies in dark mode.

3. If you're using the `class` strategy, you need to add the `dark` class to an element (commonly the `html` or `body` element) when you want to enable dark mode:

   ```jsx
   // Dark mode not enabled
   <html>
     {/* Content */}
   </html>

   // Dark mode enabled
   <html className="dark">
     {/* Content */}
   </html>
   ```

4. You can use JavaScript to toggle dark mode based on user preference. For example, you can store the user's preference in `localStorage` and add/remove the `dark` class accordingly:

   ```javascript
   // On page load or when changing themes
   if (
     localStorage.theme === 'dark' ||
     (!('theme' in localStorage) && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches)
   ) {
     document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
   } else {
     document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark');
   }

   // Whenever the user explicitly chooses light mode
   localStorage.theme = 'light';

   // Whenever the user explicitly chooses dark mode
   localStorage.theme = 'dark';

   // Whenever the user explicitly chooses to respect the OS preference
   localStorage.removeItem('theme');
   ```

   In this example, the script checks if the user has a saved theme preference in `localStorage` or if their system preference is dark mode. If either is true, it adds the `dark` class to the `html` element. If the user explicitly chooses light mode, it saves this preference in `localStorage` and removes the `dark` class. If the user chooses dark mode, it saves this preference and adds the `dark` class. If the user chooses to respect the OS preference, it removes the saved preference from `localStorage`.

Remember to adjust the class names based on any prefix you might have set in your Tailwind CSS configuration [Source 0](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode).

Sure, I can explain how to handle dark mode in Tailwind and Next.js with code samples.

Here are the steps involved:

1. **Enable dark mode in Tailwind.** In your Tailwind config file, set the `darkMode` property to `class`. This will tell Tailwind to use a class named `dark` to apply dark mode styles.

```
tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  // ...
}
```

2. **Add the `dark` class to the HTML element.** This can be done manually or with JavaScript. Here is an example of how to do it manually:

```html
<html class="dark">
<body>
  <!-- ... -->
</body>
</html>
```

3. **Write your CSS using dark mode variants.** Tailwind provides a dark variant for all of its utility classes. For example, the `bg-white` class has a dark variant called `dark:bg-black`. This means that when dark mode is enabled, the background color will be black instead of white.

Here is an example of how to use dark mode variants in your CSS:

```css
.container {
  background-color: bg-white;
  /* When dark mode is enabled, the background color will be black. */
  background-color: dark:bg-black;
}
```

4. **(Optional) Customize the dark mode class name.** By default, the dark mode class name is `dark`. However, you can customize this by setting the `darkMode` property to an array with your custom selector as the second item.

For example, the following code will use the `[data-mode="dark"]` selector for dark mode:

```
tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: ['class', '[data-mode="dark"]'],
  // ...
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
