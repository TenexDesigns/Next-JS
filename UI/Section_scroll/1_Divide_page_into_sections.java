Sure, you can divide a page into vertical sections with vertical scrolling in Tailwind CSS and Next.js using the following steps:

Create a new Next.js project.
Install Tailwind CSS.
Create a style file and add the following code:


".section {
  height: 80vh;
  width: 30%;
  overflow-y: scroll;
}" and


  his code will create a section element that is 100vh tall and has a vertical scrollbar.

Create the sections that you want to divide the page into. Each section should be a container element with the .section class.
Add the content that you want to each section.
Here is an example of how you could divide a page into three vertical sections:



<div class="flex flex-row">
    <div class="section">
      <h1>Section 1</h1>
      <p>This is the content of section 1.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h1>Section 2</h1>
      <p>This is the content of section 2.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h1>Section 3</h1>
      <p>This is the content of section 3.</p>
</div>


<div>"
