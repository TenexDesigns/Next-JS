It looks like you want to enable smooth scrolling on your Next.js page to reveal content that may not fit within the viewport. To achieve smooth scrolling, you can use CSS and JavaScript techniques. Below, I'll provide you with an example of how to add smooth scrolling to your Next.js page.

1. **Add CSS Styles**:

First, add CSS styles to your page to enable smooth scrolling behavior. You can do this by targeting the HTML and body elements and setting the `scroll-behavior` property to `smooth`. This CSS property controls the scrolling behavior of the page.

```jsx
<style jsx global>{`
  html,
  body {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
  }
`}</style>
```

Place this code within the `<style jsx global>` tag in your Next.js page.

2. **Create Scrollable Sections**:

Next, ensure that the content you want to reveal is organized into scrollable sections. You can use HTML and Tailwind CSS to structure your content into sections. In your code, it seems like you have several `<div>` elements that can be treated as sections.

3. **Anchor Links for Navigation**:

To enable smooth scrolling to specific sections of your page, you can add anchor links in your navigation menu or any other navigation elements. The `href` attribute should point to the corresponding section's `id`.

```jsx
<a href="#section1">Section 1</a>
<a href="#section2">Section 2</a>
<!-- Add more anchor links as needed -->
```

4. **Assign IDs to Sections**:

Assign unique `id` attributes to each of your sections. These IDs should match the `href` values in your anchor links.

```jsx
<div id="section1">Content of Section 1</div>
<div id="section2">Content of Section 2</div>
<!-- Assign IDs to other sections as well -->
```

5. **Run Your Next.js App**:

With these changes, your Next.js app should now have smooth scrolling behavior when you click on the anchor links, revealing content in sections that may not fit within the viewport. The smooth scrolling effect is achieved using the CSS `scroll-behavior` property, and the anchor links facilitate navigation to specific sections.

By implementing these steps, you can ensure that users can smoothly scroll through the content on your page, even when it extends beyond the initial viewport size.
