When structuring a website using HTML, it's important to use semantic HTML tags to provide meaning and structure to your content. Here are some commonly used HTML tags for website structure:

1. `<header>`: Represents the introductory content at the top of a page or section. Typically contains the site logo, navigation, and other header elements.
2. `<nav>`: Defines a section of navigation links. Use this tag to wrap your navigation menu.
3. `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document. It should contain the primary content unique to the page.
4. `<section>`: Represents a standalone section of content within a document. It can be used to group related content together.
5. `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition in a document, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.
6. `<aside>`: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars or pull quotes.
7. `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a document or a section. It typically contains information about the author, copyright, and contact details.

These are just a few examples of HTML tags that can be used to structure your website. It's important to choose the appropriate tags based on the content and purpose of each section.
