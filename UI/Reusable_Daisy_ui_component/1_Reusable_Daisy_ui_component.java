To turn the provided HTML structure into a reusable React component in a Next.js and Tailwind CSS application, you can create a component that accepts props for the image URL, title, and description. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a new component** in your Next.js project. You can create a file named `ProductCard.js` in your components directory (or any directory you prefer).

2. **Define the `ProductCard` component** and use props to receive the image URL, title, and description:

   ```jsx
   // components/ProductCard.js

   import React from 'react';

   const ProductCard = ({ imageUrl, title, description }) => {
     return (
       <div className="card w-96 bg-base-100 shadow-xl">
         <figure>
           <img src={imageUrl} alt={title} />
         </figure>
         <div className="card-body">
           <h2 className="card-title">{title}</h2>
           <p>{description}</p>
           <div className="card-actions justify-end">
             <button className="btn btn-primary">Buy Now</button>
           </div>
         </div>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default ProductCard;
   ```

3. **Use the `ProductCard` component** in your application. Import it wherever you want to display a product card, and pass the necessary props:

   ```jsx
   // pages/index.js or any other page where you want to use the ProductCard

   import React from 'react';
   import ProductCard from '../components/ProductCard';

   const Home = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         {/* Example usage of ProductCard */}
         <ProductCard
           imageUrl="/images/stock/photo-1606107557195-0e29a4b5b4aa.jpg"
           title="Shoes"
           description="If a dog chews shoes whose shoes does he choose?"
         />

         {/* You can use ProductCard multiple times with different props */}
         <ProductCard
           imageUrl="/images/another-image.jpg"
           title="Another Product"
           description="Description of another product."
         />

         {/* ... add more ProductCard instances as needed */}
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default Home;
   ```

4. **Style the component**: You can continue to use Tailwind CSS classes to style the `ProductCard` component as needed. You can also pass additional props for custom styling if required.

By creating the `ProductCard` component, you can easily reuse the same card structure throughout your Next.js application while passing different image URLs, titles, and descriptions as props to customize each card.
