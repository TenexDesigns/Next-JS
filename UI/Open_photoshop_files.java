1. **Adobe Photoshop Express:** Adobe offers a free online version of Photoshop called Adobe Photoshop Express. It allows you to view and make basic edits to PSD files directly in your web browser.

6. **Online File Converters:** You can also use online file conversion services to convert PSD files to other formats like JPEG or PNG, which can be opened in many image viewers or editors.

Please note that while these alternatives allow you to view and edit PSD files to varying degrees, they may not support all the advanced features and layer effects that Adobe Photoshop offers. The level of compatibility can vary, so it's a good idea to test with your specific PSD files to ensure they work as expected in your chosen software.
