To center the text inside a `div` with an image background both horizontally and vertically using Tailwind CSS and Next.js, you can use the `flex` and `items-center` classes. Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
<div className="h-80 w-full bg-cover bg-no-repeat bg-center flex items-center" style={{ backgroundImage: "url('img/testimonial.jpg')" }}>
  <div className='text-8xl text-white'>
    George
  </div>
</div>
```

In this code:

1. I added the `flex` class to the outer `div`, which makes it a flex container.

2. I added the `items-center` class to the outer `div`, which centers its children vertically.

With these changes, the text inside the `div` will be centered both horizontally and vertically within the container with the image background.
