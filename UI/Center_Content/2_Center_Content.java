To center the content within the `<section>` tag, you can use a combination of Tailwind CSS utility classes. 

The `flex` class will make the section a flex container, `justify-center` will center the content along the horizontal axis, and `items-center` will center the content along the vertical axis. 

If you want to center the content in both directions, you can use all three classes. Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
<section className='flex justify-center items-center'>
    <div className='mx-10 my-20'>
        <Carosel className="flex-1" images={images}/>
    </div>

    <div>
        Helloo Geore
    </div>
</section>
```

This will center both the carousel and the "Helloo Geore" text within the section.
