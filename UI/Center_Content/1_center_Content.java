To center the context within the section brackets in the code you provided, you can use the `flex` and `justify-center` utility classes.

To use the `flex` utility class, you need to add it to the parent element of the content you want to center. In this case, the parent element is the `section` element.

To use the `justify-center` utility class, you need to add it to the child element of the `section` element that contains the content you want to center.
  In this case, the child element is the `div` element that contains the carousel and the "Helloo Geore" text.

Here is the updated code:

```html
<section class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="mx-10 my-20 flex-1">
    <Carousel className="flex-1" images={images} />
  </div>

  <div>
    Helloo Geore
  </div>
</section>
```

The `flex` utility class will make the `section` element a flex container. The `justify-center` utility class will justify the content of the `section` element to the center.

This will center the carousel and the "Helloo Geore" text within the section brackets.

You can also use the `mx-auto` utility class to center the `section` element horizontally on the page. However, this will not center the content of the `section` element vertically.

If you want to center the content of the `section` element vertically, you can use the `align-items-center` utility class. However, this will only work if the `section` element has a fixed height.

I hope this helps!
