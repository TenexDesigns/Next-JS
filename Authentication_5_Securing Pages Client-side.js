For securing pages on the client-side in a Next.js application using NextAuth.js, you should use import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'.

The useSession hook from next-auth/react is a React hook that allows you to access the session data on the client-side. Its the easiest way to check if someone is signed in. Here's an example of how you can use it to secure a page:

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'

export default function Page() {
  const { data: session, status } = useSession()

  if (status === 'loading') {
    return <p>Loading...</p>
  }

  if (status === 'unauthenticated') {
    return <p>Access Denied</p>
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Protected Page</h1>
      <p>You can view this page because you are signed in.</p>
    </>
  )
}
In this example, a loading message is displayed while the session status is loading. If the session status is unauthenticated, an access denied message is displayed. If the user is authenticated, the contents of the protected page are displayed.

The getSession function, on the other hand, is primarily used for server-side rendering and API routes. Its used to fetch session data from your NextAuth.js session store on the server-side. This function is not suitable for client-side use because it makes a network request, which can cause performance issues on the client-side.

As for import { useSession } from 'next-auth/client', this is the old import path for the useSession hook in NextAuth.js versions prior to v4. In NextAuth.js v4 and later, the client-side import source has been renamed to next-auth/react. Therefore, you should use import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react' in newer versions of NextAuth.js next-auth.js.org, next-auth.js.org, next-auth.js.org.

  To secure pages client-side in Next.js using NextAuth.js, you should use the useSession hook from next-auth/react library. Heres the breakdown of the three imports you mentioned and when to use each:

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react': This import is used to access the useSession hook from the next-auth/react library. It provides an easy way to access the session information client-side in your Next.js components. You can use this hook to check the authentication status of the user and conditionally render content or redirect the user based on their authentication state.

import { getSession } from 'next-auth/react': This import is used to access the getSession function from the next-auth/react library. It allows you to retrieve the users session server-side in an API route or server-side function. You can use this function to perform server-side authorization checks, fetch user-specific data, or handle any server-side logic based on the user's session.

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/client': This import is used to access the useSession hook from the next-auth/client library, which is the legacy way of importing the useSession hook in NextAuth.js. It is recommended to use next-auth/react instead, as it provides improved performance and better integration with React.

In summary, for client-side authentication and securing pages in Next.js using NextAuth.js, you should use the useSession hook from next-auth/react. It allows you to access the users session information and perform client-side authentication checks. If you need to retrieve the session information server-side, you can use the getSession function from next-auth/react in API routes or server-side functions.
