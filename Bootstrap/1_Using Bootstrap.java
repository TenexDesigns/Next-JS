To use Bootstrap in Next.js, you can either install it globally or locally.

**Global Installation:**

```
npm install bootstrap@5.1.3
```

**Local Installation:**

```
npm install bootstrap@5.1.3
```

Once Bootstrap is installed, you can import it into your Next.js project:

```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

You can also import specific Bootstrap components into your Next.js pages:

```javascript
import { Button } from 'bootstrap';
```

To use Bootstrap components, simply wrap them in a `div` element with the `className` attribute set to the Bootstrap component name. For example, to render a button, you would do the following:

```javascript
<div className="btn btn-primary">Click me!</div>
```

You can also use Bootstrap's CSS grid system to layout your Next.js pages. To do this, you can use the `Grid` and `Col` components. For example, to create a two-column layout, you would do the following:

```javascript
<div className="container">
  <Grid>
    <Col sm={6}>Column 1</Col>
    <Col sm={6}>Column 2</Col>
  </Grid>
</div>
```

For more information on using Bootstrap in Next.js, please see the Bootstrap documentation: https://dev.to/anuraggharat/adding-bootstrap-to-nextjs-39b2.

Here is an example of a complete Next.js page that uses Bootstrap:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

const IndexPage = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1 className="mb-5">Bootstrap in Next.js</h1>
      <Button variant="primary">Click me!</Button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default IndexPage;
```

To run this page, you would first need to start the Next.js development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Once the development server is running, you can open the page in your web browser at http://localhost:3000: https://locall.host/3000/.
