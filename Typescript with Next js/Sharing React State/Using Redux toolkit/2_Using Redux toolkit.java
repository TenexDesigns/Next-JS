Handling state in a React application using Redux Toolkit involves defining actions, reducers, and a store to manage the state updates and interactions between components. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to handle the cart state in your React application using Redux Toolkit:

1. Create Actions:

Define actions to represent the operations that modify the cart state. These actions will be dispatched by components to trigger state changes.

JavaScript
import { createSlice } from
 
'@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
  products: [],
};

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'cart',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    addProduct: (state, action) => {
      state.products.push(action.payload);
    },
    removeProduct: (state, action) => {
      state.products = state.products.filter((product) => product.id !== action.payload);
    },
  },
});

export
 
const { addProduct, removeProduct } = cartSlice.actions;
Use code with caution. Learn more
2. Define the Reducer:

The reducer function handles state updates based on the dispatched actions. It receives the current state, the action, and returns the updated state.

JavaScript
const reducer = cartSlice.reducer;
Use code with caution. Learn more
3. Create the Store:

The store is the central state management system that holds the application's state and facilitates state updates.

JavaScript
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const store = createStore(reducer);
Use code with caution. Learn more
4. Integrate with React Components:

Use the Provider component from Redux Toolkit to wrap your application's root element, making the store available to all child components.

JavaScript
import React from
 
'react';
import { Provider } from
 
'react-redux';
import App from
 
'./App';
import store from
 
'./store';

const Root = () => (
  <Provider
 
store={store}>

    
<App />

  
</Provider>
);

export
 
default Root;
Use code with caution. Learn more
5. Access State in Components:

Use the useSelector hook to access the cart state from any component in your application.

JavaScript
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const Cart = () => {
  const cartProducts = useSelector((state) => state.cart.products);

  // Use cartProducts to display the list of products in the cart
  return (
    <ul>
      {cartProducts.map((product) => (
        <li key={product.id}>{product.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
Use code with caution. Learn more
6. Dispatch Actions from Components:

Use the useDispatch hook to dispatch actions from components, triggering state updates based on user interactions.

JavaScript
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

const Nav = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const cartProducts = useSelector((state) => state.cart.products);

  const addToCart = (product) => {
    dispatch(addProduct(product));
  };

  const removeFromCart = (product) => {
    dispatch(removeProduct(product));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Number of items in cart: {cartProducts.length}</p>
      <button onClick={addToCart}>Add Product</button>
      <button onClick={removeFromCart}>Remove Product</button>
    </div>
  );
};
Use code with caution. Learn more
This approach provides a structured and organized way to manage state in your React application using Redux Toolkit, enabling efficient and predictable state updates across components.
