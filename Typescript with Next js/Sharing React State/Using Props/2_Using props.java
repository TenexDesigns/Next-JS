In Redux Toolkit, you can manage state by creating "slices" of state. A slice includes a reducer and actions. The reducer is a function that determines how the state should change in response to an action. The actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your Redux store.

Here's how you can create a slice for your cart:

```jsx
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const cartSlice = createSlice({
 name: 'cart',
 initialState: [],
 reducers: {
   addItem: (state, action) => {
     state.push(action.payload);
   },
   removeItem: (state, action) => {
     return state.filter(item => item.id !== action.payload);
   },
 },
});

export const { addItem, removeItem } = cartSlice.actions;

export default cartSlice.reducer;
```

In this example, `createSlice` is a function from Redux Toolkit that generates a slice of state. The `addItem` and `removeItem` reducers are defined to handle adding and removing items from the cart.

Then, you can use the `Provider` component from `react-redux` to make the Redux store available to your components, and the `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks to dispatch actions and select state:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { Provider, useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import cartReducer from './cartSlice';
import Cart from './Cart';
import Nav from './Nav';

const store = configureStore({
 reducer: {
   cart: cartReducer,
 },
});

function App() {
 return (
   <Provider store={store}>
     <Cart />
     <Nav />
   </Provider>
 );
}

export default App;
```

In your `Cart` and `Nav` components, you can use `useDispatch` to dispatch the `addItem` and `removeItem` actions, and `useSelector` to select the cart state:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { addItem, removeItem } from './cartSlice';

function Cart() {
 const dispatch = useDispatch();
 const cart = useSelector(state => state.cart);

 // ...
}

function Nav() {
 const cart = useSelector(state => state.cart);

 // ...
}
```

In this example, `useDispatch` returns a reference to the `dispatch` function from the Redux store. You can use this to dispatch actions. `useSelector` is a hook that allows you to extract data from the Redux store state. It accepts a selector function as its argument, which is used to compute derived data from the store [Source 0](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-redux-toolkit-to-manage-state-in-react-apps/), [Source 2](https://dev.to/cherisefoster/using-redux-toolkit-for-state-management-in-react-2nmm), [Source 4](https://dev.to/muratcanyuksel/global-state-management-in-react-js-with-redux-toolkit-a-practical-guide-1olh), [Source 11](https://dev.to/theadultnoble_6/how-to-use-redux-toolkit-with-react-native-2dm5), [Source 25](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/redux-and-redux-toolkit-for-beginners/).
