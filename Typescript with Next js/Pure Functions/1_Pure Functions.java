**Pure Functions in React**

In functional programming, a function is considered pure if it always returns the same output for the same input and doesn't cause any side effects. Side effects include mutating global variables, changing input values, making network requests, and interacting with the browser [Source 14](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pure-function-vs-impure-function/), [Source 2](https://dev.to/keevcodes/pure-functions-in-react-2o7n).

In the context of React, a component is considered pure if it renders the same output for the same state and props. React provides the `React.PureComponent` base class for class components and `React.memo` for functional components to treat them as pure components. These pure components can have performance benefits since React implements the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method for them with a shallow comparison for props and state [Source 0](https://blog.logrocket.com/what-are-react-pure-functional-components/), [Source 12](https://dev.to/sumitkharche/pure-components-in-react-57on).

**Why Use Pure Functions in React**

Using pure functions in React can have several benefits:

- **Predictability:** Since pure functions always return the same output for the same input, they are easier to reason about and test [Source 2](https://dev.to/keevcodes/pure-functions-in-react-2o7n).

- **Performance:** Pure components in React can prevent unnecessary re-renders, leading to performance improvements [Source 0](https://blog.logrocket.com/what-are-react-pure-functional-components/).

- **Code simplicity:** Pure functions are easier for other developers to understand and maintain because they donâ€™t mutate data or depend on external state [Source 3](https://upmostly.com/tutorials/what-are-pure-functions-and-can-react-components-be-pure-as-well).

**Impure Functions in React**

In contrast, an impure function is a function that contains one or more side effects. It doesn't always return the same output for the same input, and it can mutate external state or depend on it. In React, components that manage their own state or perform side effects (like making network requests in lifecycle methods) are considered impure [Source 14](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pure-function-vs-impure-function/).

**Pros and Cons of Impure Functions**

Impure functions are not inherently bad and, in fact, are necessary in many cases. For example, most React components are impure because they manage their own state or have side effects like making network requests. However, impure functions can be harder to understand and test because their output can depend on external state and they can have side effects that affect other parts of your application [Source 14](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pure-function-vs-impure-function/), [Source 2](https://dev.to/keevcodes/pure-functions-in-react-2o7n).

**How to Solve Impurity**

Impurity in functions can be managed by following certain principles:

- **Immutability:** Always return new objects or arrays instead of mutating existing ones.

- **Isolation of side effects:** Perform side effects (like network requests) in specific places (like lifecycle methods or hooks in React components).

- **Use of pure components:** Use `React.PureComponent` or `React.memo` for components that only depend on their props and state and render the same output for the same props and state.

- **Use of state management libraries:** Libraries like Redux or MobX encourage the use of pure functions and help manage state in a predictable way [Source 12](https://dev.to/sumitkharche/pure-components-in-react-57on), [Source 3](https://upmostly.com/tutorials/what-are-pure-functions-and-can-react-components-be-pure-as-well).
