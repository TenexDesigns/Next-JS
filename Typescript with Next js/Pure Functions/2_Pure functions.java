### Pure Functions in React:

**Pure Functions:**
- A pure function is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output, and it has no side effects. That means it doesn't modify external state, relies only on its input, and doesn't cause observable changes outside of the function.

**Why Use Pure Functions:**
- Predictability: Pure functions make code more predictable and easier to reason about since their behavior is solely determined by their inputs.
- Testability: Pure functions are easy to test because they have no hidden dependencies or side effects.
- Debugging: Debugging is simplified since the behavior of a pure function is isolated to its input parameters.

### Impure Functions in React:

**Impure Functions:**
- An impure function is a function that has side effects or depends on external state. It might modify variables outside its scope, change global state, or have other observable changes beyond the function.

**Pros and Cons:**

**Pros of Impure Functions:**
- Practicality: In real-world applications, impure functions are often necessary for interacting with external systems, managing state, or performing asynchronous operations.

**Cons of Impure Functions:**
- Predictability: Impure functions can introduce unpredictability, making it harder to reason about the behavior of your application.
- Testability: Testing impure functions can be more challenging due to side effects and dependencies.

### Impurity of Functions in React:

**Solving Impurity:**
- In React, the goal is to isolate impure functions and manage side effects in a controlled way. This is typically achieved using hooks like `useEffect` for handling side effects and state management.

**Example - Impure Function:**
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ImpureComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Impure function with side effect
    fetchData().then((result) => setData(result));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures the effect runs only once

  return <div>{data}</div>;
}

async function fetchData() {
  // Side effect: Fetching data
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

**Example - Pure Function:**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function PureComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  const handleClick = async () => {
    // Pure function with no side effect
    const result = await fetchData();
    setData(result);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Fetch Data</button>
      <div>{data}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

async function fetchData() {
  // Pure function with no side effect
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

By using hooks like `useEffect` and managing side effects in controlled ways, React allows you to maintain the benefits of pure functions while handling the practicalities of interacting with the outside world. This helps strike a balance between predictability and real-world application needs.
