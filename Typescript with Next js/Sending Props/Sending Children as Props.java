In React, you can pass children as props by wrapping them in a component and including them between the opening and closing tags of that component. Here's an example using your provided code:

```tsx
// AppProp.tsx

import React, { ReactNode } from "react";

interface TextProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

const AppProp = (props: TextProps) => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{props.children}</h1>
    </>
  );
};

export default AppProp;
```

In the above code, we define a simple functional component `AppProp` that takes a prop named `children` of type `ReactNode`. `ReactNode` is a type that represents any node that could be rendered in React, including numbers, strings, elements, or an array of elements.

Now, you can use this component and pass children to it in another file:

```tsx
// AnotherComponent.tsx

import React from "react";
import AppProp from "./AppProp";

const AnotherComponent = () => {
  return (
    <AppProp>
      <div>Hello George</div>
      {/* You can include any React elements, strings, or numbers as children */}
      <p>How are you?</p>
    </AppProp>
  );
};

export default AnotherComponent;
```

In this example, `AnotherComponent` is using the `AppProp` component and passing two children: a `<div>` with the text "Hello George" and a `<p>` with the text "How are you?". The children are specified between the opening and closing tags of the `AppProp` component.

When `AppProp` renders, it will display the content of its `children` prop, which includes the provided `<div>` and `<p>` elements.

This is a common pattern in React for creating reusable components that can wrap and render arbitrary content passed to them as children.
