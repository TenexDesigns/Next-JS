When we say that components should handle only displaying markup and handling user interactions at a high level, it means that the primary responsibility of a component should be to render the UI and manage user interactions. The component should not be responsible for fetching data, performing complex computations, or managing the application state. These responsibilities should be delegated to other parts of the application, such as services or state management libraries.

This separation of concerns is a key principle in software design, and it helps to make the code more maintainable, testable, and scalable. By keeping components focused on their primary responsibility, you can ensure that they are easy to understand and modify. It also makes it easier to reuse components in different parts of the application [Source 4](https://blog.bitsrc.io/10-best-practices-for-structuring-react-projects-426ae8b1af43).

Here are some best practices to consider when building React applications:

**1. Maintain a Clear Folder Structure**

A clear and logical folder structure helps keep your code organized and easy to understand. For example, you can group files according to their routes and features, keeping all related files for a particular feature in one folder [Source 9](https://kinsta.com/blog/react-best-practices/).

**2. Break Down the Application Into Smaller Components**

As your application grows, it becomes crucial to divide it into smaller, reusable components. Each component should encapsulate a specific part of the application's functionality [Source 7](https://dev.to/sammychris/how-to-organize-your-react-application-effectively-4hg9).

**3. Use Code Splitting**

Code splitting is a technique for optimizing the performance of a React app by dividing the code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This can improve the initial load time of an app by only loading the code needed upfront rather than loading the entire codebase at once [Source 0](https://scrimba.com/articles/react-project-structure/).

**4. Handle Errors Effectively**

Handling errors effectively is often overlooked but is mandatory in the long run to have a solid error handling inside your application. Especially when the application is deployed to production [Source 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/best-practices-for-react/).

**5. Use the React Context API to Avoid Prop Drilling**

The React Context API is an advanced React feature that will make your React code easier to follow in certain scenarios where you need to share a value [Source 0](https://scrimba.com/articles/react-project-structure/).

**6. Use Shorthand for Boolean Props**

Often there are scenarios where you pass boolean props to a component. You don't need to do it necessarily like this because the occasion of the prop itself is either truthy (if the prop is passed) or falsy (if the prop is missing) [Source 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/best-practices-for-react/).

Remember, these are guidelines and not hard and fast rules. The specific structure that works best for your project will depend on its size, complexity, and other factors. It's worth taking the time to carefully plan and implement a code organization strategy that works well for your particular project [Source 0](https://scrimba.com/articles/react-project-structure/).
