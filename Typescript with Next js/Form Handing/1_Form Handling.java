There are several libraries available for handling forms in React. Here are some of the most popular ones:

1. **Formik**: This is one of the most popular form libraries for React. It provides a set of tools to handle form state, validation, and submission. It uses a declarative approach, which makes it easy to read and understand. It also has a large community, so you can find plenty of examples and support. Here's an example of how to use Formik:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { Formik, Form, Field, ErrorMessage } from 'formik';

   const LoginForm = () => (
    <div>
      <Formik
        initialValues={{ email: '', password: '' }}
        validate={values => {
          const errors = {};
          if (!values.email) {
            errors.email = 'Required';
          } else if (
            !/^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$/i.test(values.email)
          ) {
            errors.email = 'Invalid email address';
          }
          return errors;
        }}
        onSubmit={(values, { setSubmitting }) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2));
            setSubmitting(false);
          }, 400);
        }}
      >
        {({ isSubmitting }) => (
          <Form>
            <Field type="email" name="email" />
            <ErrorMessage name="email" component="div" />
            <Field type="password" name="password" />
            <ErrorMessage name="password" component="div" />
            <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
              Submit
            </button>
          </Form>
        )}
      </Formik>
    </div>
   );

   export default LoginForm;
   ```

2. **React Hook Form**: This is a lightweight library that provides a single hook (`useForm`) to handle form state and validation. It's a good choice if you want to keep your components simple and clean. Here's an example of how to use React Hook Form:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

   function App() {
     const { register, handleSubmit, errors } = useForm();
     const onSubmit = data => console.log(data);

     return (
       <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
         <input name="example" defaultValue="test" ref={register} />
         <input name="exampleRequired" ref={register({ required: true })} />
         {errors.exampleRequired && <span>This field is required</span>}
         <input type="submit" />
       </form>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

3. **React Final Form**: This library is great for complex forms where you need to keep track of the visited fields or form state. It provides a set of tools to handle form state, validation, and submission. Here's an example of how to use React Final Form:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { Form, Field } from 'react-final-form';

   const MyForm = () => (
     <Form
       onSubmit={onSubmit}
       render={({ handleSubmit }) => (
         <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
           <Field
             name="firstName"
             component="input"
             placeholder="First Name"
           />
           <button type="submit">Submit</button>
         </form>
       )}
     />
   );

   const onSubmit = values => {
     console.log(values);
   };

   export default MyForm;
   ```

Each of these libraries has its own strengths and weaknesses, so the best one for you depends on your specific needs and preferences.
