Sure, here are some additional validations you can add to your React Hook Form:

**Built-in Validations:**

React Hook Form provides a variety of built-in validation methods, including:

* `required`: Ensures the field is not empty.
* `minLength`: Requires the field to have a minimum length.
* `maxLength`: Limits the field to a maximum length.
* `pattern`: Validates the field against a regular expression.
* `validate`: Allows you to define custom validation logic.

**Yup and Schema Validations:**

Yup is a third-party validation library that provides more powerful and customizable validation rules. It allows you to define complex validation schemas for your forms. You can integrate Yup with React Hook Form to leverage its advanced validation capabilities.

**Custom Validations:**

You can also define your own custom validation functions using the `validate` prop of the `register` function. This allows you to implement any validation logic that you need beyond the built-in or Yup options.

**Schema Validation:**

Schema validation refers to the process of defining and enforcing a predefined structure for data. In the context of forms, schema validation ensures that user inputs adhere to the expected format and constraints. Yup provides a powerful mechanism for defining schema-based validations, allowing you to specify rules for each field and their relationships.

**Using Yup with React Hook Form:**

To integrate Yup with React Hook Form, follow these steps:

1. Install Yup using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install yup
```

2. Import Yup and use it to define your schema:

```javascript
import yup from 'yup';

const schema = yup.object({
  name: yup.string().required().min(3),
  email: yup.string().email().required(),
  age: yup.number().min(18).max(100),
});
```

3. Pass the schema to the `useForm` hook:

```javascript
const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm({
  resolver: yupResolver(schema),
});
```

4. Use the `register` function to register fields and apply validation rules:

```javascript
<input
  {...register('name')}
  id="name"
  type="text"
  className="form-control"
/>
```

5. Handle form submission and validation errors:

```javascript
const onSubmit = (data: FieldValues) => console.log(data);
console.log(errors);
```

This integration allows you to leverage Yup's powerful schema validation capabilities within your React Hook Form application.
