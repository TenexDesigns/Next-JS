Redux and Redux Toolkit are both state management libraries for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. 

**Redux** is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. It helps to create a single source of truth for your application's state, which is especially useful for large applications with complex state interactions [Source 2](https://dev.to/azadulkabir455/redux-vs-redux-toolkit-472b).

**Redux Toolkit**, on the other hand, is an official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It's intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It aims to simplify most common Redux use cases, including store setup, defining reducers, immutable update logic, and creating entire slices of state at once. Redux Toolkit abstracts the basic Redux code and provides us with boilerplates that enable us to write Redux code in fewer lines of code [Source 21](https://redux.js.org/redux-toolkit/overview/).

While Redux is powerful, it often requires writing a lot of boilerplate code, and it's easy to make mistakes. Redux Toolkit aims to solve these issues by providing a set of utilities that simplify the most common Redux use cases. It also includes good practices that help you structure your code better [Source 9](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-redux-toolkit-is-preferred-over-redux/).

If you are starting a new project or if you are already familiar with Redux, Redux Toolkit is recommended. But before learning the Redux Toolkit, you should learn Redux basics, such as Actions, Reducers, and Store, and their work procedures [Source 2](https://dev.to/azadulkabir455/redux-vs-redux-toolkit-472b).

To learn more about **Redux**, you can refer to the official Redux documentation [Redux Documentation](https://redux.js.org/), or you can check out tutorials and articles like this one on FreeCodeCamp [FreeCodeCamp Redux Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/redux-for-beginners-the-brain-friendly-guide-to-redux/).

Redux and Redux Toolkit are both state management libraries for React, with Redux Toolkit being a set of utilities and best practices to simplify the use of Redux. Let's explore both and discuss their use cases.

### Redux:

1. **Redux Core Principles:**
   - **Store:** Maintains the state of your entire application.
   - **Actions:** Represent events that can change the state.
   - **Reducers:** Specify how the state changes in response to an action.

2. **Common Pain Points:**
   - Boilerplate: Redux can involve writing a lot of boilerplate code for actions, action creators, and reducers.
   - Configuration: Setting up a Redux store and configuring middleware can be complex.

3. **Learning Resources:**
   - **Official Redux Documentation:** [Redux Docs](https://redux.js.org/)
   - **Video Tutorials:** There are many tutorials on platforms like YouTube that cover Redux concepts.

### Redux Toolkit:

1. **Purpose:**
   - Redux Toolkit is an official opinionated set of tools and guidelines to simplify Redux development.

2. **Key Features:**
   - **createSlice:** A function that generates a reducer and its actions given a reducer function, initial state, and a set of "slice" reducers.
   - **configureStore:** A function that wraps createStore with the common setup for Redux, including middleware, the Redux DevTools Extension, and the ability to add reducers.
   - **createAsyncThunk:** A utility to simplify handling asynchronous actions.

3. **Advantages:**
   - **Reduces Boilerplate:** Significantly reduces the amount of boilerplate code required for common Redux patterns.
   - **Built-in Immutability:** Uses Immer under the hood, making it easy to write reducers that "mutate" state in a more natural way.

4. **Learning Resources:**
   - **Official Redux Toolkit Documentation:** [Redux Toolkit Docs

React state management libraries are essential tools for handling the state of components in React applications. They provide a structured and organized approach to managing and updating data across components, ensuring consistency and data flow throughout the application.

Redux and Redux Toolkit are two popular state management libraries for React applications. Both offer different approaches to managing state, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

**Redux**

Redux is a state management library that follows a unidirectional data flow architecture. This means that there is a single source of truth for the application state, and all state changes are made through a central dispatch function. Redux provides a predictable and consistent way to manage state, making it easier to reason about and debug complex applications.

**Redux Toolkit**

Redux Toolkit is a collection of tools that simplifies the development of Redux applications. It provides a more concise and opinionated API, making it easier to get started with Redux and reducing the amount of boilerplate code. Redux Toolkit also includes several additional features, such as createSlice, which simplifies the creation of reducers.

**Which is better to use?**

The best state management library for your React application will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you are looking for a flexible and powerful state management library with a strong community, Redux is a good choice. However, if you are looking for a more user-friendly and opinionated library with a smaller learning curve, Redux Toolkit is a better option.

**Where to read and find out more about each**

There are many resources available to learn more about Redux and Redux Toolkit. Here are a few suggestions:

* **Redux documentation:** [https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

* **Redux Toolkit documentation:** [https://redux-toolkit.js.org/](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

* **"A Complete Guide to Redux" by Dan Abramov:** [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/redux-for-beginners-the-brain-friendly-guide-to-redux/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/redux-for-beginners-the-brain-friendly-guide-to-redux/)

* **"Getting Started with Redux Toolkit" by Kent C. Dodds:** [https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-react](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-react)

In addition to these resources, there are many blog posts, tutorials, and videos available online that can help you learn more about Redux and Redux Toolkit.

Once you have a basic understanding of both libraries, you can experiment with them to see which one you prefer. There is no right or wrong answer, so the best way to decide is to try both out and see which one works best for you.
