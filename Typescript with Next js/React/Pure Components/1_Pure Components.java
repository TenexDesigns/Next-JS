To keep components pure , keep chanages out of the render phases


  Side effects
  - Store data in local storage
  - Call the server to fetch/save data
  - Manualy modify the dom


  UseEffect
  - To excute a piece of code after a component has rendred
 - After render

  We can have multiple useEffect, react will excute them in order


  -React renders each component because of stric mode in development
