To use Material-UI (also known as MUI from version 5 onwards) in a React TypeScript Vite project, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Create a new Vite project with React and TypeScript**:

If you haven't created a Vite project yet, you can do so by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm init @vitejs/app my-app --template react-ts
cd my-app
npm install
```
Replace `my-app` with the name of your project. This will create a new React TypeScript project with Vite [Source 7](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-react-project-with-vite).

2. **Install Material-UI and its dependencies**:

Material-UI uses the CSS-in-JS solution Emotion for styling. You can install Material-UI and its dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
If you want to use Material-UI's icons, you can install them with this command:

```bash
npm install @mui/icons-material
```

3. **Use Material-UI components in your app**:

Now you can start using Material-UI components in your app. Here's an example of how you can use a Button component:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

function App() {
  return (
    <Button variant="contained">Hello World</Button>
  );
}

export default App;
```

By following these steps, you should be able to use Material-UI in your React TypeScript Vite project. For more information on using Material-UI with TypeScript, you can refer to the [TypeScript guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/typescript/) on the Material-UI documentation.
