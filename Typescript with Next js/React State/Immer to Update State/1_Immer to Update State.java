Immer is a JavaScript library that makes working with immutable state more convenient. It simplifies the process of updating nested data structures, such as objects and arrays, in a more mutable-looking way. Immer is often used with React and Redux applications to handle state updates in a more readable and concise manner.

Here's how you can use Immer to update an array of objects in a React state:

### Installing Immer:

First, you need to install Immer:

```bash
npm install immer
```

### Using Immer in React:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import produce from 'immer';

function ImmerExample() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([
    { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' },
  ]);

  const updateItem = (idToUpdate, newName) => {
    setItems(
      produce((draft) => {
        const itemToUpdate = draft.find((item) => item.id === idToUpdate);
        if (itemToUpdate) {
          itemToUpdate.name = newName;
        }
      })
    );
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {items.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            {item.name}
            <button onClick={() => updateItem(item.id, 'Updated Item')}>Update</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ImmerExample;
```

In this example, `produce` from Immer is used inside the `setItems` callback. It creates a draft of the state, allowing you to directly modify it in a more mutable-looking way. Immer then ensures that the modifications are applied immutably, providing a more readable syntax for updating nested data structures.

Immer can be particularly useful when dealing with more complex state structures or deeply nested objects. It helps you avoid creating unnecessary copies of your state while making the code more expressive. Keep in mind that while Immer can improve code readability, it's not always necessary for simpler state updates. It depends on the specific needs of your application.
