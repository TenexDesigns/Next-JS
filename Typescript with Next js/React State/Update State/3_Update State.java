Updating state in React should always be done in an immutable way. This means that instead of modifying the current state directly, you should create a new copy of the state with the changes applied. This is important because React's diffing algorithm relies on the concept of immutability to determine if it needs to re-render the component.

**Updating Simple State:**

For simple state (like a number or string), you can just pass the new value to the `setState` function (for class components) or the state setter function returned by `useState` (for functional components).

```jsx
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); // class component
setCount(count + 1); // functional component
```

**Updating Object State:**

When your state is an object, you should create a new object with the updated properties. You can use the spread operator (`...`) to create a new object with the existing properties, and then override the properties you want to change.

```jsx
this.setState({ ...this.state, count: this.state.count + 1 }); // class component
setCount({ ...count, value: count.value + 1 }); // functional component
```

**Updating Nested Object State:**

Updating nested objects can be a bit more complex because you need to create a new object for the root object and each nested object that you're updating. Again, you can use the spread operator to do this.

```jsx
this.setState({
  ...this.state,
  nestedObject: {
    ...this.state.nestedObject,
    key: newValue
  }
}); // class component

setNestedObject({
  ...nestedObject,
  key: {
    ...nestedObject.key,
    subKey: newValue
  }
}); // functional component
```

In this example, `key` is a property of `nestedObject`, and `subKey` is a property of `key`.

For deeply nested objects or complex state, you might want to consider using a state management library like Redux or MobX, or the `useReducer` hook provided by React, which can make managing complex state easier.
