In Next.js, as in any web development project, it's important to follow correct HTML tag nesting to ensure proper rendering and avoid issues related to hydration and accessibility. Here's the correct order of nesting HTML tags:

1. **Block-Level Elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<section>`, `<article>`):**
   Block-level elements are typically used for structuring the layout of your page. You can nest other block-level elements within these.

2. **Inline Elements (e.g., `<a>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`):**
   Inline elements are used for styling or marking up text within block-level elements. You can nest inline elements within block-level elements.

3. **Interactive Elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<input>`, `<a>`):**
   Interactive elements are elements that users can interact with, such as buttons and links. While it's generally not recommended to nest interactive elements within each other, you can nest inline elements within interactive elements. However, be cautious when nesting interactive elements within block-level elements, as this can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior and may not be semantically correct.

4. **Text-Level Elements (e.g., `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`):**
   Text-level elements are used to apply specific styling to text within inline elements. You can nest text-level elements within inline elements.

Here's an example of correct nesting:

```html
<div>
  <p>This is a block-level element.</p>
  <a href="#">This is a link (interactive element) within a block-level element.</a>
  <span>This is an inline element within the link.</span>
</div>
```

Incorrect nesting, such as placing a `<div>` inside a `<p>`, can lead to unexpected rendering issues and can sometimes cause problems with hydration and accessibility. Always strive for semantic and well-structured HTML to ensure your Next.js application functions correctly.
