The correct order of nesting of any HTML tags is to nest interactive content within non-interactive content. This means that you should not nest a `<button>` or `<a>` tag within another `<button>` or `<a>` tag, and you should not nest a `<p>` tag inside another `<p>` tag or a `<div>` tag inside a `<p>` tag.

Here are some examples of correct HTML tag nesting:

```html
<div>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
</div>

<button type="submit">Submit</button>

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

Here are some examples of incorrect HTML tag nesting:

```html
<button type="submit">
  <a href="/">Home</a>
</button>

<p>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</p>

<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <div>This is a div.</div>
</div>
```

If you are experiencing hydration errors in Next.js, it is important to check that you are nesting your HTML tags correctly. You can use a browser developer tool, such as Chrome DevTools, to inspect the HTML and CSS of your app and identify any incorrect tag nesting.

Here are some additional tips for avoiding hydration errors in Next.js:

* Use the same components, props, and state on both the server and the client.
* Avoid using dynamic imports in your components.
* Use the `useEffect()` hook to initialize any state that depends on asynchronous operations on the server, and then use the `useState()` hook to initialize the same state on the client.

I hope this helps!
