In HTML, certain elements are not allowed to be nested within each other. Here are some general rules:

1. Block-level elements, like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, etc., can contain other block-level elements and inline elements. However, there are exceptions. For example, a `<p>` (paragraph) element cannot contain other block-level elements, only inline elements.

2. Inline elements, like `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<button>`, etc., cannot contain block-level elements, but they can contain other inline elements. However, interactive content elements like `<a>` and `<button>` should not be nested within each other.

3. The `<li>` element should be a direct child of `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<menu>`.

4. The `<td>` or `<th>` elements should be direct children of `<tr>`, which should be a direct child of `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, or `<tfoot>`.

5. The `<option>` element should be a direct child of `<select>` or `<datalist>`.

6. The `<figcaption>` element should be a direct child of `<figure>`.

These are general rules and there are more specific ones depending on the elements. It's always a good idea to validate your HTML using a tool like the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure it's correctly structured.
