The error message you're seeing is due to a mismatch between the HTML that was initially rendered on the server and the React tree that was rendered during the first render in the browser. This process is known as hydration. A few common causes for this error are:

- Incorrect nesting of HTML tags
- Using checks like `typeof window !== 'undefined'` in your rendering logic
- Using browser-only APIs like `window` or `localStorage` in your rendering logic
- Incorrectly configured CSS-in-JS libraries [Source 0](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error)

To debug this issue, you can use the following steps:

1. **Check for incorrect HTML tag nesting:** Ensure that you're not nesting interactive content like `<button>` or `<a>` tags within each other, or using incorrect tag nesting like `<p>` inside another `<p>` or `<div>` inside a `<p>`.

2. **Check for browser-specific logic in your rendering:** Make sure you're not using browser-only APIs or checks like `typeof window !== 'undefined'` directly in your rendering logic. If you need to use these, consider moving this logic inside a `useEffect` hook or using dynamic imports to load components client-side only. Here's an example of using `useEffect`:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true)
  }, [])

  return <h1>{isClient ? 'This is never prerendered' : 'Prerendered'}</h1>
}
```

3. **Check your CSS-in-JS configuration:** If you're using a CSS-in-JS library, make sure it's correctly configured according to the official Next.js examples.

4. **Disable SSR on specific components:** If certain components are causing hydration issues, you can disable server-side rendering (SSR) for them using dynamic imports:

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const NoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/no-ssr'), { ssr: false })

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <NoSSR />
    </div>
  )
}
```

5. **Use `suppressHydrationWarning` for inevitable differences:** If there's content that will inevitably differ between the server and client (like timestamps), you can silence the hydration mismatch warning by adding `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to the element.

If the issue persists, you may want to consider using React's Profiler to get a detailed breakdown of what's rendering and potentially causing the mismatch. You can also try removing components one by one to isolate the problem component.

I hope this helps you to debug the hydration error. Let me know if you have any further questions! [Source 0](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error)
