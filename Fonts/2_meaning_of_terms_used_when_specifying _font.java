The CSS code snippet you provided is used to define and specify the characteristics of a custom font for use in a web application. Let me break down each part of it for you:

1. **`font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono Medium';`**:
   - This part sets the name or family of the font. In this case, it's named "IBM Plex Mono Medium." This is the name you will use in your CSS to apply this font to specific elements.

2. **`src: url('/fonts/IBMPlexMono-Medium.ttf') format('truetype');`**:
   - `src` specifies the source of the font file.
   - `url('/fonts/IBMPlexMono-Medium.ttf')` is the URL or path to the font file on your web server. It tells the browser where to fetch the font file.
   - `format('truetype')` specifies the format of the font file. In this case, it's Truetype (TTF) format.

3. **`font-weight: 500;`**:
   - This sets the font weight. The value of 500 corresponds to "Medium" in the font's weight scale. You can adjust this value to specify different font weights like "bold," "light," etc., based on the font's available weights.

4. **`font-style: normal;`**:
   - This sets the font style. "Normal" means that it's not italic or oblique. You can change it to "italic" if you have an italic version of the font.

5. **`font-display: swap;`**:
   - This specifies how the font should be displayed while it's loading. "Swap" is used to indicate that the browser should display the fallback font first and then swap to the custom font when it's ready. This helps prevent the invisible text while the custom font is loading.

To find out these details for a font you want to use, you can follow these steps:

1. **Font Name (font-family)**:
   - This is usually provided by the font creator or foundry. It's the name of the font family as defined in the font files.

2. **Font URL (src)**:
   - You need to host the font file on your web server or use a third-party font hosting service like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts. Once hosted, you'll get the URL to the font file.

3. **Font Format**:
   - The font format depends on the file type you have. Common formats for web fonts include TrueType (TTF), OpenType (OTF), WOFF (Web Open Font Format), and WOFF2. You need to specify the format that matches your font file.

4. **Font Weight**:
   - Check the documentation or information provided with the font to find the available font weights. Common weights include normal, bold, light, etc.

5. **Font Style**:
   - Check if the font has different styles, such as italic or oblique. Specify "normal" for regular styles and "italic" for italicized styles.

6. **Font Display**:
   - You can choose "swap" as a good default value for the `font-display` property. This ensures a smoother user experience by displaying the fallback font until the custom font is ready.

Make sure to verify the licensing and usage rights for the font you want to use, especially if it's not a free or open-source font.
