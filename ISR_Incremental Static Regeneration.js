Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) is a feature in Next.js that allows you to update static pages incrementally, without having to rebuild all the pages during each build process. It helps address the issue of stale data in statically generated pages and provides a balance between performance and real-time updates.

With ISR, you can specify a revalidation time for each static page, indicating how often Next.js should attempt to regenerate the page with updated data. This allows you to have a mix of statically generated and dynamically updated content in your Next.js application.

Heres an example code snippet that demonstrates the usage of ISR in Next.js:

jsx
Copy code
// pages/blog/[slug].js

import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

// This function runs at build time to fetch the initial static paths
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Fetch the list of blog slugs from an API or database
  const slugs = await fetch('https://api.example.com/blog-slugs');
  const data = await slugs.json();

  // Return an array of objects containing the params (slug) for each page
  const paths = data.map((slug) => ({ params: { slug } }));

  return { paths, fallback: true }; // Enable fallback for incremental static regeneration
}

// This function runs at build time to fetch the initial data for the specific path
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Fetch the blog post data based on the slug
  const blogPost = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/blog/${params.slug}`);
  const data = await blogPost.json();

  return {
    props: {
      blog: data,
    },
    revalidate: 60, // Revalidate the page every 60 seconds (1 minute)
  };
}

function BlogPost({ blog }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  // During fallback, show a loading state or a placeholder
  if (router.isFallback) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  // Render the actual blog content
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{blog.title}</h1>
      <p>{blog.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BlogPost;
In this example, the getStaticPaths function fetches the list of blog slugs from an API or database. It returns an array of objects containing the params object for each page, representing the dynamic part of the page's URL.

The getStaticProps function is responsible for fetching the initial data for a specific path (identified by the slug). It fetches the blog post data based on the slug and returns it as props. Additionally, it specifies a revalidation time of 60 seconds using the revalidate property.

Inside the BlogPost component, the router.isFallback property is checked to handle the fallback state when the page is being incrementally generated. During the fallback state, you can display a loading state or a placeholder while the page is being regenerated.

With ISR and the combination of getStaticPaths, getStaticProps, and the revalidate property, Next.js will generate the static pages during the build process, and then incrementally regenerate them based on the specified revalidation time.

This way, you can have the benefits of static generation with the ability to update the content at regular intervals, ensuring that your pages stay up to date without the need for manual rebuilds or SSR for every request.

Note: The fallback property in getStaticPaths determines the behavior when a path doesnt have a pre-rendered static page. If fallback is set to false, Next.js returns a 404 page for unknown paths. If fallback is set to true, Next.js generates the page on-demand and caches it for future requests.

  Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) is a feature in Next.js that allows pages to be updated incrementally after the initial build, combining the benefits of Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

Traditionally, in SSG, if you wanted to update the static content of your site, you would need to rebuild the entire site, which could be time-consuming and inefficient, especially for large websites. ISR solves this problem by allowing you to regenerate individual pages at runtime as traffic comes in, thus reducing the build time and ensuring the data on your site is not stale atatus.com, dev.to.

Here's how you can use ISR in Next.js:

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData() // Fetch data from an API

  return {
    props: {
      data
    },
    revalidate: 1, // Regenerate the page every 1 second
  }
}
In this example, Next.js will pre-render the page at build time using the data fetched by fetchData(). If a request comes in more than 1 second after the page was last generated, Next.js will regenerate the page in the background while serving the stale page to the user. Once the page has been regenerated, Next.js will serve the new page to subsequent users atatus.com, blog.logrocket.com.

ISR can be particularly useful for sites where the data changes frequently, such as e-commerce sites, blogs, or ad-backed media. However, it's worth noting that ISR is not a one-size-fits-all solution and might not be suitable for all use cases. For example, if your revalidation period is larger than the time it takes to rebuild your entire site, traditional static-site generation might be a better option smashingmagazine.com.
