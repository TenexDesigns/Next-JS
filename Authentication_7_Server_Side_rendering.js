Server-side authentication in Next.js, especially when using next-auth, involves handling the user session on the server side and then pre-rendering the page before sending it to the client. This can be done in Next.js using getServerSideProps or inside server-side API routes.

When a user sends a request, the server checks if theres a valid session for the user. If a valid session exists, the server pre-renders the requested page with the user's data and sends it to the client. If a valid session does not exist, the server can redirect the user to a sign-in page.

next-auth provides a method called getServerSession which is recommended for use on the server side. This method can drastically reduce response time when used over getSession on the server side, due to avoiding an extra fetch to an API Route (which is generally not recommended in Next.js).

Heres a simple example of how you can use getServerSession in a Next.js page:




import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth/react'

function Blog({data}) {
  return (
    <div>Blog Pages - {data}</div>
  )
}

export default Blog

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const session = await getServerSession(context.req)

  const data =  session? 'List of 100 blogs available to signed in uses'     :      'List of 10 free blogs available to unsigned in users'

  return {
    props: {
        data
    }
  }
}

Sure, the provided code is an example of server-side authentication in Next.js using next-auth. The getServerSideProps function is used to fetch the user's session on the server side before the page is rendered.

Heres an explanation of the code:




1.The Blog function is a Next.js page that receives data as a prop and renders it inside a div element.

2.getServerSideProps is a special function provided by Next.js where you can fetch data on the server side before the page is rendered.

3.Inside getServerSideProps, getServerSession is used to fetch the user's session from the request (context.req). This function is provided by next-auth/react.

4.If a session exists (i.e., the user is signed in), data is set to 'List of 100 blogs available to signed in users'. If a session does not exist (i.e., the user is not signed in), data is set to 'List of 10 free blogs available to unsigned in users'.

5.Finally, getServerSideProps returns an object with a props property containing data. This data is passed as a prop to the Blog page.

6.This setup ensures that the Blogs page displays different content based on whether the user is signed in or not, and this decision is made on the server side before the page is rendered next-auth.js.org, nextjs.org, next-auth.js.org.
