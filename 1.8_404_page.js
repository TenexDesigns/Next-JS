In Next.js, you can create a custom 404 page to handle routes that are not found. By default, Next.js provides a default 404 page, but you can customize it to match the design and functionality of your application.

To create a custom 404 page in Next.js, follow these steps:

1.Create a file named 404.js or 404.tsx in the pages directory of your Next.js project.
2.In the 404.js file, export a React component as the default export. This component will serve as your custom 404 page.
3.Customize the component to display the desired content for your 404 page. You can add text, images, links, or any other elements as needed.



  Here is a simple example of a custom 404 page:

// pages/404.js
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Custom404() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Go back home</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
}

In the above code, we have a simple function component that renders a title and a link to go back to the home page.

You can add any valid JSX to your 404 component, including other components, styling, and even data fetched at build time using getStaticProps (nextjs.org).

Heres a more complex example that includes a search bar and links to other popular pages in your application:

// pages/404.js
import Link from 'next/link';

const NotFoundPage = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
        <p>Sorry, there is nothing to see here</p>
        <p>
          Use the search box or the links below to explore our amazing
          application
        </p>
        <input
          type='search'
          placeholder='Just a dummy search box...'
        />
        <div>
          <Link href='/'>Homepage</Link>
          <Link href='/latest'>Latest Products</Link>
          <Link href='/contact'>Contact US</Link>
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
export default NotFoundPage;
In this example, weve added a search input and links to the homepage, latest products page, and contact page (slingacademy.com).

To see your custom 404 page in action, start your Next.js development server with npm run dev and navigate to a non-existent route in your application (geeksforgeeks.org).

  In Next.js, you can create a custom 404 page to handle routes that are not found. By default, Next.js provides a default 404 page, but you can customize it to match the design and functionality of your application.

To create a custom 404 page in Next.js, follow these steps:

Create a file named 404.js or 404.tsx in the pages directory of your Next.js project.
In the 404.js file, export a React component as the default export. This component will serve as your custom 404 page.
Customize the component to display the desired content for your 404 page. You can add text, images, links, or any other elements as needed.
Here's an example of a custom 404 page in Next.js:

jsx
Copy code
function Custom404() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
      <p>The page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
      <Link href="/">Go back to the home page</Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Custom404;
In the example above, the Custom404 component is a simple page displaying a heading, a paragraph, and a link to navigate back to the home page. You can customize this component to suit your application's design and content.

Next.js will automatically use this 404.js (or 404.tsx) file as the custom 404 page. Whenever a route is not found, Next.js will render this component, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience for your application's users.

Remember to also deploy the custom 404 page when you deploy your Next.js application. The deployment process may vary depending on the hosting platform or service you are using.

By creating a custom 404 page, you have full control over the content and layout of the page, allowing you to provide helpful information and navigation options for users who encounter non-existent routes in your Next.js application.

  To create a custom 404 page in Next.js, you need to create a 404.js file in the pages directory of your application. This file is statically generated at build time. In this file, you can define and export a React component that will be displayed whenever a user tries to navigate to a route that does not exist in your application (netlify.com, geeksforgeeks.org, slingacademy.com, nextjs.org).

Here is a simple example of a custom 404 page:

// pages/404.js
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Custom404() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Go back home</a>
