`async/await` is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to work with asynchronous code in a more synchronous and readable way. It's typically used when dealing with operations that may take some time to complete, such as making HTTP requests, reading/writing files, or working with databases.

Here's what `async/await` does and how it's used in the context of the example I provided earlier:

1. **What `async/await` does:**
   - `async`: The `async` keyword is used before a function declaration or expression. It tells JavaScript that the function will contain asynchronous code and that it will return a promise.
   - `await`: The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function. It is used to pause the execution of the function until the promise is resolved. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks more like synchronous code.

2. **Where to use `async/await`:**
   - You should use `async/await` in situations where you need to wait for asynchronous operations to complete before moving on to the next steps in your code. This is especially useful when you have multiple asynchronous operations that depend on each other's results or need to be executed sequentially.

Now, let's see how `async/await` is used in the context of the example:

- **Create Book Component:**
  ```javascript
  const onSubmit = async (values, { resetForm }) => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post('/api/books', values);
      resetForm();
      onSuccess(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error creating book:', error);
    }
  };
  ```
  In the `onSubmit` function of the Create Book component, `async/await` is used when making an HTTP POST request to create a new book. `await` is used before `axios.post()`, which means the code will pause until the POST request is completed. This ensures that `resetForm()` is only called after a successful book creation.

- **Read Books Component:**
  ```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchBooks = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('/api/books');
        setBooks(response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching books:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchBooks();
  }, []);
  ```
  In the Read Books component, `async/await` is used inside the `useEffect` hook to fetch books from an API. Again, `await` is used before `axios.get()`, ensuring that `setBooks(response.data)` is only called after the GET request is completed.

- Similar patterns with `async/await` are used in the Update and Delete Book components when making PUT and DELETE requests, respectively.

By using `async/await`, you can write asynchronous code that is more readable and maintains the expected sequence of operations, making your code easier to understand and debug.
