In the provided code context, the `onSuccess` function is not explicitly defined within the code you shared. It is a placeholder function that is expected to be passed as a prop to the `CreateBook` component. The purpose of this function is to handle the successful completion of the book creation operation. Here's how it should be used:

1. **Define the `onSuccess` Function in the Parent Component:**
   
   In your parent component (the component that renders the `CreateBook` component), you should define the `onSuccess` function to handle the successful creation of a book. For example:

   ```jsx
   const handleSuccess = (newBookData) => {
     // Handle the successful creation of a new book here.
     // You can update the UI, show a success message, or perform any other actions.
     console.log('Book created successfully:', newBookData);
   };
   ```

2. **Pass the `onSuccess` Function as a Prop to the `CreateBook` Component:**

   When rendering the `CreateBook` component in your parent component, pass the `onSuccess` function as a prop like this:

   ```jsx
   <CreateBook onSuccess={handleSuccess} />
   ```

3. **Use the `onSuccess` Function in the `CreateBook` Component:**

   Inside the `CreateBook` component, after successfully creating a book (after the axios POST request), you can call the `onSuccess` function to handle the success scenario. For example:

   ```javascript
   const onSubmit = async (values, { resetForm }) => {
     try {
       const response = await axios.post('/api/books', values);
       resetForm();
       onSuccess(response.data); // Call the onSuccess function with the new book data.
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error creating book:', error);
     }
   };
   ```

By passing the `onSuccess` function as a prop and using it in the `CreateBook` component, you can customize the behavior of your application when a new book is successfully created. It allows you to perform actions such as updating the UI, displaying a success message, or triggering other related actions in response to the successful creation of a book.
