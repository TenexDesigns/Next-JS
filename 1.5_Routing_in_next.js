1. Routing in Next.js:

Next.js uses a file-based routing system where each file in the pages directory corresponds to a route in the application. For example, a file at pages/about.js would be served at the /about URL. This is the default behavior and does not require any additional configuration reacthustle.com.

2. Routing with Pages:

For basic routing, simply create a .js (or .jsx, .ts, .tsx) file under the pages directory. The file path relative to pages directory will be the URL path. For example, if you create a file pages/about.js, it will be accessible at www.yourwebsite.com/about.

3. Nested Routes:

Nested routes can be introduced in this file system by creating sub-directories inside the pages directory. For example, a file at pages/blog/first-post.js would be served at the /blog/first-post URL geeksforgeeks.org.

4. Dynamic Routes:

Dynamic routes can be defined by naming a file or directory in the pages directory with square brackets. For example, a file at pages/posts/[id].js would match any route like /posts/1, /posts/abc, etc., and the value inside the brackets (id in this case) would be passed as a query parameter to your page stackoverflow.com.

5. Nested Dynamic Routes:

For nested dynamic routes, you can create a directory with square brackets and place an index.js file or another dynamic route inside. For example, a file at pages/posts/[id]/comments.js would match any route like /posts/1/comments, /posts/abc/comments, etc. stackoverflow.com.

6. Catch All Routes:

Catch all routes can be defined by using three dots (...) inside the square brackets. For example, a file at pages/posts/[...id].js would match any route like /posts/a, /posts/a/b, /posts/a/b/c, etc. The parts of the URL after /posts/ will be passed as an array to your page reacthustle.com.


  Catch all Routes Example

import { useRouter } from "next/router"



function DocsPage() {
  const {params =[]} = useRouter().query
  console.log(params)

  if(params.length ===2){
    return <h1> Viewing Dos for reature {params[0]} and concept {params[1]}</h1>

  }else if (params.length ===1){
    return <h1> Viwinng Docs for feature {params[0]}</h1>
  }

 
  return <h1> Docs for Home Page</h1>

}

export default DocsPage

Routing in Next.js:
Routing in Next.js allows you to navigate between different pages in your application. It provides a file-based routing system, where each page is represented by a corresponding file in the /pages directory. Next.js uses the file system to determine the routing structure of your application.

Routing with Pages:
In Next.js, you can create a new page by adding a new file in the /pages directory. For example, if you create a file named about.js in the /pages directory, it will automatically create a route for the /about URL. You can then access the page by navigating to http://localhost:3000/about.

Nested Routes:
Next.js supports nested routes by organizing your pages in nested folders within the /pages directory. For example, if you create a folder named blog inside the /pages directory and place an index.js file inside it, the route will be /blog. Similarly, if you create a file named post.js inside the blog folder, the route will be /blog/post.

Dynamic Routes:
Dynamic routes in Next.js allow you to create dynamic pages with dynamic URLs. You can define a page that matches a dynamic pattern by creating a file with square brackets in the /pages directory. For example, creating a file named [id].js inside the /pages directory will allow you to access dynamic routes like /post/1, /post/2, etc.

Nested Dynamic Routes:
You can combine nested routes and dynamic routes in Next.js. For example, if you create a folder named blog and a file named [slug].js inside it, you can have dynamic routes like /blog/post-1, /blog/post-2, etc. The [slug] part of the URL will be treated as a dynamic parameter.

Catch-All Routes:
Catch-all routes in Next.js allow you to create routes that match any pattern. By creating a file with square brackets and three dots (e.g., [[...slug]].js), you can create catch-all routes. This allows you to handle various levels of nested paths.

Routing in Next.js provides a flexible and intuitive way to define the structure of your application and handle different types of routes. It enables you to create dynamic and nested routes, making it easier to build complex applications with Next.js.
