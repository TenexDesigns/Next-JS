The code you provided is defining a custom error class in JavaScript/TypeScript, specifically for handling authentication-related errors in a Next.js application. Let's break down the code:

```javascript
export class AuthRequired extends Error {
  constructor(message = 'Auth is required to access this page') {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'AuthRequired Error';
  }
}
```

Here's what each part of the code does:

1. **`export class AuthRequired extends Error {`**:  
   - This declares a class named `AuthRequired` that extends the built-in `Error` class. By extending `Error`, you're creating a custom error class with additional functionality.

2. **`constructor(message = 'Auth is required to access this page') {`**:  
   - This is the constructor method of the `AuthRequired` class.
   - The `constructor` method is called when an instance of the class is created.
   - It takes an optional `message` parameter, which defaults to `'Auth is required to access this page'`.
   - If a custom message is not provided when creating an instance, this default message will be used.

3. **`super(message);`**:  
   - The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor of the superclass (`Error` in this case).
   - It passes the provided `message` (or the default one if not provided) to the `Error` constructor.

4. **`this.name = 'AuthRequired Error';`**:  
   - The `name` property of an `Error` object represents the name of the error (usually the name of the constructor function).
   - In this case, it sets the `name` property to `'AuthRequired Error'`.

Now, if you create an instance of this `AuthRequired` class and throw it like this:

```javascript
throw new AuthRequired();
```

You'll get an error object with a custom message and name. For example:

```javascript
try {
  throw new AuthRequired();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.name);    // 'AuthRequired Error'
  console.error(error.message); // 'Auth is required to access this page'
}
```

This custom error class can be useful for signaling authentication-related issues in your Next.js application. It allows you to throw specific errors that you can catch and handle appropriately, such as redirecting the user to a login page when authentication is required.
