Type 'String' is not assignable to type 'Key | null | undefined'.ts(2322)


The issue is with the `key` attribute in the `map` function. In React, the `key` attribute should be a unique identifier for each element in the array, and it should be a string or a number. However, in your code, you are using the entire string object as the `key`, which is causing the TypeScript error.

Instead of using `key={i}`, you should use `key={index}` or something similar. Here's the corrected code:

```tsx
{items.map((i, index) => (
  <li
    onClick={() => {
      setIndex(index);
      console.log(i, index);
      onSelectItem(i);
    }}
    className={
      selectedIndex === index ? "list-group-item active" : "list-group-item"
    }
    key={index} // Use index as the key
  >
    {i}
  </li>
))}
```

By using `key={index}`, you ensure that each element in the array has a unique identifier based on its position in the array. This aligns with React's expectations for the `key` attribute.

Make sure to replace `index` with a more appropriate unique identifier if you have one. Using the array index as the `key` is acceptable in many cases, but it might not be suitable if the order of the items can change.
