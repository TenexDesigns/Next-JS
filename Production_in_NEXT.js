THE ABOVE ITEMS EXPLAINED



In a production environment of Next.js, the application is built and optimized for performance. The information you provided represents the size of the generated JavaScript (JS) files for each route (page) of the application. Let's break down the information:

Route (pages): The path of each page in your Next.js application.
Size: The size of the corresponding JS file for each page. It represents the amount of code that needs to be downloaded by the clients browser when accessing that specific page.
First Load JS: The size of the JS code that is shared and loaded by all pages. It includes framework code, main application code, and other necessary chunks.

Heres an explanation of the symbols used in the information:

○ (Static): This symbol indicates that the page is automatically rendered as static HTML. These pages do not require any initial props and are pre-rendered at build time.
● (SSG): This symbol indicates that the page is automatically generated as static HTML along with JSON data. These pages use the getStaticProps function to fetch data at build time and pre-render the page with the fetched data.
For example, lets take a closer look at one of the lines in the information:

bash
Copy code
├ ○ /about (374 ms)                 253 B         74.2 kB
/about is a route (page) in your application.
It is pre-rendered as static HTML (○ symbol) and doesn't require initial props.
The size of the JS file for this page is 253 bytes, and the total size of the initial JS load is 74.2 kilobytes.
In general, Next.js optimizes the application by pre-rendering pages, using static generation (SSG) or server-side rendering (SSR) depending on the configuration. The goal is to reduce the client-side processing and provide fast loading times by generating optimized JS bundles for each route.

Its worth noting that the information you provided seems to be the result of a build process or optimization step, showing the sizes of the generated JS files for each page. This information helps you understand the size and load times of your application, allowing you to optimize the performance and reduce the initial load for better user experience.
