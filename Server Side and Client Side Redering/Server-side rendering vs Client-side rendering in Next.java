In Next.js, you can choose between Server-side Rendering (SSR) and Client-side Rendering (CSR) based on the requirements of your application. 

**Server-side Rendering (SSR)** in Next.js is achieved by exporting an async function called `getServerSideProps` from your page. This function is called by the server on every request and is suitable for pages that need to pre-render frequently updated data fetched from an external API. Here's an example of how to implement SSR in Next.js:

```javascript
export default function Page({ data }) {
  // Render data...
}
 
// This gets called on every request
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Fetch data from external API
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)
  const data = await res.json()
 
  // Pass data to the page via props
  return { props: { data } }
}
```

**Client-side Rendering (CSR)** in Next.js can be implemented in two ways: using React's useEffect() hook inside your pages instead of the server-side rendering methods (getStaticProps and getServerSideProps), or using a data fetching library like SWR or TanStack Query to fetch data on the client. Here's an example of CSR using `useEffect()` inside a Next.js page:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
 
export function Page() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)
 
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`)
      }
      const result = await response.json()
      setData(result)
    }
 
    fetchData().catch((e) => {
      // handle the error as needed
      console.error('An error occurred while fetching the data: ', e)
    })
  }, [])
 
  return <p>{data ? `Your data: ${data}` : 'Loading...'}</p>
}
```

The choice between SSR and CSR depends on the specific needs of your application. SSR is typically used for pages that need SEO optimization and initial fast page load, while CSR is usually chosen for pages that have a lot of interactivity and where the data changes frequently.

In Next.js, it's possible to use both SSR and CSR in the same application. This flexibility allows you to decide on a per-page basis whether to use SSR or CSR, depending on the needs of each specific page. [Source 3](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/rendering)

It's also worth noting that Next.js supports Static Site Generation (SSG), where the HTML is generated at build time and then reused on each request. This can be a good choice for pages that don't need to be updated on each request and can provide a performance benefit. [Source 3](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/rendering)

Finally, even though Next.js is designed with server-side rendering in mind, it's possible to use it for client-side rendering only. You can achieve this by avoiding the use of Next.js data fetching methods like `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, and instead using client-side data fetching methods such as fetching data in the `useEffect` hook.

In the context of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR), the statement "This can be a good choice for pages that don't need to be updated on each request" means that SSR is a suitable technique for pages where the content doesn't change frequently or doesn't depend on specific user interactions or dynamic data.

Let's break down the statement and its implications:

1. **Good Choice for Pages:** SSR is a good choice for certain pages within a web application, specifically those where initial load performance and SEO are important factors.

2. **Don't Need to be Updated on Each Request:** By "don't need to be updated on each request," it means that the content of these pages doesn't change significantly between different users or different requests from the same user. The content can be considered relatively static or semi-static, at least for short periods of time.

3. **Can Provide a Performance Benefit:** SSR can offer a performance benefit because it generates the fully rendered HTML on the server and sends it to the client. This means that when a user requests such a page, they receive a complete HTML document right away. It can lead to faster initial page loads and improved user experience, especially on slower or resource-constrained devices.

In the context of web development:

- "Updated on each request" typically refers to content that changes based on factors like user authentication, user-specific data, or real-time data updates. For example, a personalized dashboard that displays a user's recent activities would be a page that needs frequent updates based on the user's actions.

- "Don't need to be updated on each request" implies that the content can remain consistent or change infrequently without affecting the user experience. This content can be efficiently rendered on the server, making SSR a suitable choice.

In summary, SSR is beneficial when you have pages with relatively static content that doesn't change with each user request. It provides advantages like improved SEO and initial load performance. However, for pages with highly dynamic or user-specific content, CSR may be a better choice to deliver real-time updates and interactivity.
