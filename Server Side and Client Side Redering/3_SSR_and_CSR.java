In Next.js, both client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR) have their own recommended use cases. Here's a breakdown of the recommended applications for each:

Client-side Rendering (CSR):
1. Adding interactivity and event listeners like `onClick()`, `onChange()`, and others.
2. Using state management hooks like `useState()`, `useReducer()`, and lifecycle effects like `useEffect()`.
3. Utilizing browser-only APIs.

Example usage of CSR in Next.js:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example, the counter component uses `useState()` to manage a count state and updates it when the button is clicked.

Server-side Rendering (SSR):
1. Fetching data from an API or backend resources.
2. Accessing sensitive information on the server, such as access tokens or API keys.
3. Keeping large dependencies on the server to reduce client-side JavaScript.

Example usage of SSR in Next.js:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function HomePage({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
      <p>Data from the server: {data}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}

export default HomePage;
```

In this example, the `getServerSideProps` function is used to fetch data from an API on the server and pass it as props to the component for server-side rendering.

It's important to note that Next.js supports different rendering methods, including server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering. Each method has its own use cases and benefits, and you can choose the appropriate method based on your project's requirements.
