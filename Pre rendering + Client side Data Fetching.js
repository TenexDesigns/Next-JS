In Next.js, you have the flexibility to combine pre-rendering (server-side rendering and static site generation) with client-side data fetching. This approach allows you to fetch additional data on the client-side after the initial page render, providing an interactive and dynamic user experience. Here's how you can achieve pre-rendering and client-side data fetching in Next.js:

Pre-rendering:
Next.js offers two pre-rendering methods: server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).

Server-side Rendering (SSR):
With SSR, the server renders each page on every request, fetching data and returning a fully populated HTML page to the client.
To implement SSR in Next.js, you can use the getServerSideProps function in your page component. Inside this function, you can fetch data from an API or perform any other server-side operations.
Here's an example:

jsx
Copy code
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Fetch data from an API or perform server-side operations
  const data = await fetchData();

  // Pass the fetched data as props to the page component
  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}

function MyPage({ data }) {
  // Render the page using the fetched data
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyPage;
Static Site Generation (SSG):
With SSG, Next.js generates HTML pages at build time and serves them statically. This approach is suitable for pages with data that doesn't change frequently.
To implement SSG, you can use the getStaticProps function in your page component. Inside this function, you can fetch data from an API or any other data source.
Here's an example:

jsx
Copy code
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Fetch data from an API or perform data operations
  const data = await fetchData();

  // Pass the fetched data as props to the page component
  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
    // Optional: Set revalidation time to update the data periodically
    revalidate: 60, // In seconds
  };
}

function MyPage({ data }) {
  // Render the page using the fetched data
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyPage;
Client-side Data Fetching:
Once the initial page is rendered, you can perform additional data fetching on the client-side using React Query, fetch(), or any other data fetching libraries.
To perform client-side data fetching, you can use the useQuery hook from React Query or make use of JavaScript's fetch() function within your component's lifecycle methods (useEffect, componentDidMount, etc.).

jsx
Copy code
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

function MyComponent() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery('myData', fetchData);

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  // Render the page using the fetched data
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
By combining pre-rendering with client-side data fetching, you can provide a seamless user experience with initial data pre-loaded on the server and subsequent data fetching on the client-side for interactive updates.

  In Next.js, there are two main strategies for pre-rendering: Static Generation (SG) and Server-side Rendering (SSR).

Static Generation (SG) is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at build time. The pre-rendered HTML is then reused on each request. It's great for pages that can be pre-rendered ahead of a user's request. You can also add some client-side data fetching to Static Generation for handling constantly updating data or user-specific data.

Server-side Rendering (SSR) is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on each request. It's great for pages that have data that changes constantly and needs to be real-time.

Next.js provides specific functions for fetching data for pre-rendering: getStaticProps and getServerSideProps.

Client-side Data Fetching

In addition to pre-rendering, you can also fetch data on the client side. This strategy is useful when your page needs to include user-specific data, and you don't want to pre-render the page with this data.

With Next.js, you can use any data fetching library to fetch data on the client side. In the context of React Query, you can use the useQuery hook in your components to fetch data after the page has been loaded:

import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

function Profile() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery('user', fetchUser);

  if (isLoading) return 'Loading...';
  if (error) return 'An error has occurred';

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <p>{data.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
In this example, fetchUser is a function that fetches a user's data.

Combining Pre-rendering and Client-side Data Fetching

In some cases, you might want to pre-render some parts of the page and then fetch additional data on the client side. This can be achieved with Next.js and React Query.

For example, you might want to pre-render a blog post with Static Generation (using getStaticProps), but the comments section, which can change frequently, might be a good candidate for client-side data fetching with React Query.

import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

// This function gets called at build time
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const postData = await getPostData(params.id);

  return {
    props: {
      postData
    }
  };
}

function Post({ postData }) {
  const { data: comments, isLoading, error } = useQuery(
    ['comments', postData.id],
    fetchComments
  );

  // Render post...
}
In this example, fetchComments is a function that fetches the comments for a post nextjs.org, swr.vercel.app, thecodest.co.
