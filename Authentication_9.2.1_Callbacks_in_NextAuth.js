In the provided context, the callbacks object is part of the NextAuth.js configuration. It allows you to define custom logic and actions to be executed at various stages of the authentication flow. Here's an explanation of the different callbacks available and their purpose:

signIn: This callback is invoked when a user attempts to sign in. It receives three parameters: user, account, and profile. You can use this callback to perform actions such as storing user data, updating last login timestamp, or logging the sign-in event. The callback should return a boolean value indicating whether the sign-in is allowed or not.

signOut: This callback is triggered when a user signs out. It receives two parameters: user and account. You can use this callback to perform additional actions, such as clearing session data or updating the user's status in your database.

session: This callback is called whenever a new session is created. It receives two parameters: session and user. You can use this callback to modify the session data or perform additional actions based on the user's session.

jwt: This callback is invoked during the token creation process. It receives two parameters: token and user. You can use this callback to customize the token payload or add additional data to the token.

redirect: This callback is triggered when a user is redirected during the authentication flow. It receives two parameters: url and baseUrl. You can use this callback to customize the redirection behavior, such as appending query parameters or changing the destination URL.

jwt: This callback is called when a JWT token is verified. It receives two parameters: token and user. You can use this callback to add additional validation or checks on the token.

session: This callback is invoked when a session is checked. It receives two parameters: session and user. You can use this callback to perform additional checks or modifications on the session data before it is returned.

These callbacks provide flexibility to customize the authentication flow and integrate your own business logic or data manipulation. You can implement actions like storing user data in a database, updating user records, or performing additional checks during various stages of the authentication process.

  In the context of NextAuth.js, callbacks are functions that are called at various points in the authentication flow. They are used to customize the behavior of NextAuth.js. Here are the callbacks you used in your code:

signIn: This callback is triggered when a user attempts to sign in. It receives user, account, and profile as arguments. The user object contains information about the user. The account object contains information about the OAuth account (like access token and provider). The profile object contains the raw profile information returned by the provider. In your code, you use this callback to store user data in your database.
Heres an example of the signIn callback:

async signIn(user, account, profile) {
  // Store user data in the database when signing in
  const result = await prisma.user.upsert({
    where: { email: user.email },
    update: { name: user.name, image: user.image },
    create: { name: user.name, email: user.email, image: user.image },
  });

  return true; // Allow sign in
},
In this callback, you're using Prisma's upsert method to either update an existing user or create a new one.

Note that if you return false from the signIn callback, sign in will be blocked. You can use this feature to implement additional checks before allowing a user to sign in (like checking if the users email is verified or if the user is blocked) en.wikipedia.org.
