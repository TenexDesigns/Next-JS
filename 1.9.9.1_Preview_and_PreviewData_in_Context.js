In Next.js, the preview and previewData properties are part of the context object provided to the getServerSideProps function. These properties are used when you want to implement the Preview Mode feature in your Next.js application.

preview: This is a boolean property that indicates if the page is in preview mode. It will be true when in preview mode and undefined otherwise.
previewData: This property holds the data you set when enabling the preview mode through the setPreviewData method. The data you set here will be available in every page of your Next.js application as long as the preview mode is enabled.
Here is an example showing how to use preview and previewData in getServerSideProps:

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // If the page is in preview mode
  if (context.preview) {
    console.log(context.previewData); // Logs the preview data
    // Fetch draft data instead of published data
    // ...
  } else {
    // Fetch published data
    // ...
  }

  // Return data as props
  // ...
}
You can use preview and previewData in getServerSideProps to fetch different data based on whether the page is in preview mode or not. For example, you might want to fetch draft data when in preview mode and published data otherwise. This is particularly useful when working with a headless CMS nextjs.org, datocms.com.

Remember that the data you set in previewData is stored in a cookie, so there's a size limitation. Currently, preview data is limited to 2KB nextjs.org.

Also, keep in mind that the preview mode isn't meant to bypass security or authentication checks. It should be used purely for previewing content changes and not for displaying different content to different users reddit.com.

In Next.js, the preview and previewData objects in the context parameter of the getServerSideProps function are related to Preview Mode. Preview Mode allows you to display a draft or unpublished version of a page before it is officially published. These objects provide information and functionality to support the Preview Mode feature.

preview Object (context.preview):

The preview object represents the state of Preview Mode for the current request.
It is a boolean value (true or false) indicating whether the current request is in Preview Mode.
You can use the preview object to conditionally render different content or apply specific logic when Preview Mode is enabled.
Example usage:
jsx
Copy code
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const isPreviewMode = context.preview;

  if (isPreviewMode) {
    // Custom logic or data fetching for Preview Mode
  } else {
    // Regular logic or data fetching for non-Preview Mode
  }

  // ...
}
previewData Object (context.previewData):

The previewData object contains the preview data sent from the preview mode API route.
It allows you to pass additional data to the getServerSideProps function when rendering a previewed page.
You can use the previewData object to customize the behavior of your page based on the preview data received.
Example usage:
jsx
Copy code
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const previewData = context.previewData;

  if (previewData && previewData.someData) {
    // Use the preview data to customize the behavior
  }

  // ...
}
The Preview Mode feature in Next.js is often used in headless CMS setups, allowing content editors or administrators to preview and verify content changes before making them public. By utilizing the preview and previewData objects, you can implement dynamic behavior specific to Preview Mode, such as fetching draft content, displaying unpublished data, or applying different styles for previewed pages.

To enable Preview Mode, you typically create an API route (e.g., /api/preview) that receives a unique preview token and sets the preview cookie. The previewData object contains any additional data you pass along with the preview token.

Its important to note that to fully implement Preview Mode, you need to configure your CMS or content source to generate and validate preview tokens, and handle the API route responsible for setting the preview cookie and passing preview data.

Refer to the Next.js documentation for detailed instructions on implementing Preview Mode and integrating it with your CMS or content source.
