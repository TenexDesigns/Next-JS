1. File-based routing:

Next.js supports file-based routing out of the box. This means that the file structure in the pages directory corresponds directly to the routes of your application. Each file in the pages directory becomes a route that gets automatically processed and rendered by Next.js. This feature simplifies the routing process and makes it more intuitive.

For example, if you create a file at pages/about.js, it will be accessible at www.yourwebsite.com/about.

2. Pre-rendering:

Pre-rendering means generating the HTML for a page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering. This is a huge advantage for performance, SEO, and even user experience.

Static Generation (Recommended): The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request. It can be used with and without data.
Server-side Rendering: The HTML is generated on each request.
3. API Routes:

Next.js provides an integrated way to build Node.js server-side applications through API Routes. This allows you to create backend API endpoints within the same Next.js app. You can do this by creating files in the pages/api directory. These files are treated as API endpoints instead of pages.

4. Support for CSS Modules:

Next.js supports CSS Modules using the [name].module.css file naming convention. CSS Modules locally scope CSS by automatically creating a unique class name. This allows you to use the same CSS class name in different components without worrying about collisions. This can be a more maintainable way to style your components.

5. Authentication:

Next.js does not include built-in authentication support. However, it provides the building blocks needed to implement authentication, and can be integrated with any authentication system, be it social logins (like Google, Facebook, GitHub), or more traditional username/password logins, or JWT-based authentication.

Other Features:

Image Optimization: Next.js has a built-in Image component that optimizes images to improve performance.
Fast Refresh: Next.js features Fast Refresh, which makes it so that changes in your React components reflect instantly without needing a page reload.
Incremental Static Generation: You can add or update static pages after you've built your site, without needing a full rebuild.
Additional Libraries:

While Next.js provides a lot of functionality out of the box, there are certain features for which you might need to add additional libraries. For example:

Form Handling: Next.js does not provide built-in form handling, so you might want to use a library like Formik for this purpose. Formik provides a set of tools to simplify form handling in React, such as form state management, validation, and error handling.
import React from 'react';
import { useFormik } from 'formik';

const SignupForm = () => {
  const formik = useFormik({
    initialValues: {
      email: '',
    },
    onSubmit: values => {
      alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2));
    },
  });
  return (
    <form onSubmit={formik.handleSubmit}>
      <label htmlFor="email">Email Address</label>
      <input
        id="email"
        type="email"
        {...formik.getFieldProps('email')}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};
In this example, Formik is used to create a simple form with an email field. The useFormik hook is used to manage the form state and handle the form submission formik.org, blog.logrocket.com.

State Management: Next.js does not include a built-in state management solution, but it can be easily integrated with state management libraries like Redux or MobX.
Styling: While Next.js supports CSS and CSS Modules, you might want to use a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components or emotion for more dynamic styling.
Remember, adding libraries should be done considering the trade-off between the functionality they provide and the additional complexity they introduce to your project.

File-Based Routing:
Next.js provides built-in file-based routing, where you can create pages by simply creating a corresponding file in the pages directory. For example, creating a file named about.js in the pages directory will automatically create a route /about in your application. This feature simplifies routing and eliminates the need for manual route configuration.

Pre-rendering:
Next.js supports both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR). With static site generation, Next.js pre-renders the pages at build time, allowing them to be served as static HTML files. This improves performance and enables SEO benefits. Server-side rendering generates pages on each request, allowing dynamic content and fetching data from external APIs.

API Routes:
Next.js allows you to create API routes alongside your pages. These routes can handle server-side logic and respond to HTTP requests. You can define API routes using the /pages/api directory. This feature enables building serverless functions and creating custom API endpoints within your Next.js application.

Support for CSS Modules:
Next.js provides built-in support for CSS modules, allowing you to write modular CSS styles scoped to specific components. CSS modules ensure that styles are locally scoped and don't clash with other components, providing better maintainability and reducing the chance of naming conflicts.

Authentication:
Next.js doesn't provide authentication out of the box, but it has extensive support for integrating with authentication libraries and services. You can easily integrate popular authentication providers like Firebase, Auth0, or implement custom authentication logic using Next.js API routes or server-side rendering.

Other Features of Next.js:

Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code into small chunks, improving performance by only loading the necessary code for each page.
Hot Module Replacement (HMR): During development, Next.js supports HMR, allowing you to see changes in your code instantly without a full page reload.
CSS-in-JS Support: Next.js has built-in support for CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or emotion, enabling you to write component styles directly in your JavaScript code.
Image Optimization: Next.js optimizes and handles image loading and lazy loading to improve performance and reduce the page load time.
Internationalization (i18n): Next.js provides features and support for building internationalized applications, allowing you to easily localize your content and handle language translations.
To add additional features like form handling, you can integrate third-party libraries like Formik or React Hook Form into your Next.js application. Next.js is flexible and can be extended with various libraries and tools to cater to specific needs.
