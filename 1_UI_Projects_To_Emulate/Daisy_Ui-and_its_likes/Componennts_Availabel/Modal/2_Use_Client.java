To implement a Daisy UI modal in a Next.js application that appears when a button is clicked, contains an input and submit button, and updates the page with data from the database upon submission, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Modal Component**:

   Create a reusable modal component using Daisy UI. This component should include an input field, a submit button, and logic to handle the submission and closing of the modal.

   ```vue
   <template>
     <d-modal v-model="showModal">
       <div>
         <input v-model="inputValue" />
         <button @click="handleSubmit">Submit</button>
       </div>
     </d-modal>
   </template>

   <script>
   export default {
     data() {
       return {
         showModal: false,
         inputValue: '',
       };
     },
     methods: {
       handleSubmit() {
         // Implement logic to handle form submission here.
         // You can make an API request to update the database.
         // After updating the data, you can close the modal.
         this.showModal = false;

         // Optionally, trigger a data refresh on the parent component.
         this.$emit('data-updated');
       },
     },
   };
   </script>
   ```

2. **Use the Modal Component**:

   In your Next.js page or component where you want to use the modal, import and use the modal component. You can conditionally render it based on a button click or any other trigger event.

   ```vue
   <template>
     <div>
       <button @click="showModal = true">Open Modal</button>
       <!-- Render the modal component -->
       <my-modal @data-updated="refreshData" />
     </div>
   </template>

   <script>
   import MyModal from '@/components/MyModal.vue';

   export default {
     components: {
       MyModal,
     },
     methods: {
       refreshData() {
         // Implement logic to refresh data on the page
         // This could involve making API requests to get updated data
       },
     },
   };
   </script>
   ```

3. **Update Data and Reflect Changes**:

   In the `handleSubmit` method of the modal component, you can make an API request to update the database with the submitted data. After the database update is successful, you can close the modal. To reflect the changes on the page, you can trigger a data refresh, as shown in the `refreshData` method of the parent component.

   In the `refreshData` method, you can make additional API requests to retrieve the updated data and update the page accordingly.

4. **Styling and Configuration**:

   You can customize the modal's appearance and behavior according to your project's requirements by modifying the modal component's template and styles.

With this setup, when a user clicks the "Open Modal" button, the modal will appear, allowing them to input data and submit it. Upon submission, the data will be updated in the database, and the modal will close. The `refreshData` method in the parent component can be used to fetch updated data and refresh the page's content, reflecting the changes made in the database.

Remember to handle API requests and database updates according to your backend setup and requirements.
