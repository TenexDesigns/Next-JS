Daisy UI provides a `button` component with various modifier classes to adjust its appearance and behavior. Below are some of the classes you can use with the `button` component:

- `btn`: This is the base class for the button component.
- `btn-neutral`, `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-accent`, `btn-info`, `btn-success`, `btn-warning`, `btn-error`: These classes change the color of the button. Each corresponds to a specific color in your Tailwind CSS theme.
- `btn-ghost`, `btn-link`, `btn-outline`: These classes change the style of the button. The `btn-ghost` class makes the button transparent with a colored border and text. The `btn-link` class styles the button as a text link. The `btn-outline` class makes the button transparent with a colored border and text.
- `btn-active`, `btn-disabled`: These classes forcefully show the active or disabled state of the button.
- `glass`: This class applies a glassmorphism effect to the button.
- `no-animation`: This class disables the click animation on the button.
- `btn-lg`, `btn-md`, `btn-sm`, `btn-xs`: These classes change the size of the button. Each corresponds to a specific size: large, medium (default), small, or extra small.
- `btn-wide`: This class adds more horizontal padding to the button, making it wider.
- `btn-block`: This class makes the button full width.
- `btn-circle`, `btn-square`: These classes change the shape of the button to be a circle or a square, respectively.

Here's an example of how to use these classes in a Next.js application:

```jsx
<button className="btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button>
<button className="btn btn-secondary btn-lg">Large Secondary Button</button>
<button className="btn btn-error btn-sm">Small Error Button</button>
<button className="btn btn-success btn-block">Full Width Success Button</button>
<button className="btn btn-ghost btn-circle">Circular Ghost Button</button>
```

In this example, we are creating several buttons with different colors, sizes, widths, and shapes. The first button is a primary button, the second is a large secondary button, the third is a small error button, the fourth is a full-width success button, and the fifth is a circular ghost button.

Remember to install Daisy UI and include it in your Tailwind CSS configuration:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'),
  ],
}
```

And then install it via npm:

```bash
npm i daisyui
```

You can mix and match these variants and modifiers to create buttons with different styles and sizes according to your application's design. These classes should cover most of your button styling needs in Daisy UI.
