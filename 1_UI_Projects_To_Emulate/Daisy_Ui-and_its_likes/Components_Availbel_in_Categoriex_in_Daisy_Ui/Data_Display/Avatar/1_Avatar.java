The `avatar` component in Daisy UI is used to show a thumbnail representation of an individual or business in the user interface. It's often used in user profiles, comments, chats, and other places where you need to show a user's image in a small and compact way.

Here's a basic example of how to use the `avatar` component:

```jsx
<div class="avatar">
  <div class="mb-8 w-24 h-24">
    <img src="https://placekitten.com/100/100" />
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, the `avatar` class is used for the container element, and an image is placed inside the avatar.

Here are some classes that you can use with the `avatar` component:

- `avatar-group`: This class is used for the container of a group of avatars.
- `online`: This class shows a green dot as an online indicator.
- `offline`: This class shows a gray dot as an offline indicator.
- `placeholder`: This class is used to show some letters as an avatar placeholder when there's no image.

You typically don't need to use a state variable to display an avatar, as the avatar's image or placeholder text can be set directly in the HTML or JSX code. However, you might need to use state if you want to dynamically change the avatar's image or online/offline status based on user interaction or other events.

Remember to install Daisy UI and include it in your Tailwind CSS configuration:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'),
  ],
}
```

And then install it via npm:

```bash
npm i daisyui
```
