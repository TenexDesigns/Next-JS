In Daisy UI, the Avatar component allows you to display user avatars with different styles and indicators, such as online and offline status. I'll explain how to use the Avatar component, its different variants, and important classes, along with code samples. You typically don't need state to display avatars.

**Using the Avatar Component**:

To use the Avatar component in your Next.js and Tailwind CSS application, you need to import it and then include it in your template. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Import the Avatar Component**:

   Import the Avatar component at the beginning of your Vue.js component or page file:

   ```vue
   import { DAvatar } from 'daisyui';
   ```

2. **Use the Avatar Component**:

   In your template, you can use the `d-avatar` component to create avatars with various styles and indicators.

   ```vue
   <template>
     <div>
       <!-- Basic Avatar -->
       <d-avatar class="avatar">
         <img src="avatar-image.jpg" alt="User Avatar" />
       </d-avatar>

       <!-- Avatar with Online Indicator -->
       <d-avatar class="avatar online">
         <img src="avatar-image.jpg" alt="User Avatar" />
       </d-avatar>

       <!-- Avatar with Offline Indicator -->
       <d-avatar class="avatar offline">
         <img src="avatar-image.jpg" alt="User Avatar" />
       </d-avatar>

       <!-- Placeholder Avatar -->
       <d-avatar class="avatar placeholder">
         JD <!-- Initials for the placeholder -->
       </d-avatar>
     </div>
   </template>
   ```

**Available Variants**:

Here are the available variants for the Avatar component:

- `avatar`: Creates a basic avatar.
- `avatar online`: Adds a green dot as an online indicator.
- `avatar offline`: Adds a gray dot as an offline indicator.
- `avatar placeholder`: Shows initials as an avatar placeholder.

You can apply these variants to the `d-avatar` component to change the style and indicators of the avatar based on its purpose.

**Do We Need State to Display Avatars**:

In most cases, you don't need to use state to display avatars. The Avatar component is designed to display user avatars with various styles and indicators, and it's typically used as a static representation of a user's profile picture or status.

You can use avatars to enhance the visual representation of users in your application, and they are not interactive components that require state management. If you need to change the avatar based on user data or provide online/offline status indicators, you can simply apply the appropriate classes (online, offline) to the `d-avatar` component based on your data.

For example, you might conditionally add the `online` or `offline` class based on a user's status:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <d-avatar class="avatar" v-if="userStatus === 'online'">
      <img src="avatar-online.jpg" alt="User Avatar (Online)" />
    </d-avatar>

    <d-avatar class="avatar offline" v-else>
      <img src="avatar-offline.jpg" alt="User Avatar (Offline)" />
    </d-avatar>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      userStatus: 'online', // Set the user's status (online or offline).
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

This way, you can dynamically change the avatar style based on user data without the need for complex state management.
