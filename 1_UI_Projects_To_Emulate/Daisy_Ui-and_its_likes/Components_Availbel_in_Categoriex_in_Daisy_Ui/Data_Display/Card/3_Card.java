Sure. Here is how to use the card component in Daisy UI in a Next.js and Tailwind application:

1. Import the Daisy UI library into your project. You can do this by using the `npm install daisyui` command.

2. Create a card element and add the `card` class to it.

3. Inside the card element, you can add any content that you want, such as text, images, or buttons.

4. You can use the `card-{variant}` modifier class to change the style of the card.

5. You can use the `card-{size}` modifier class to change the size of the card.

Here is an example of how to use the card component in a Next.js and Tailwind application:

```
import React from "react";
import { Card } from "daisyui";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>
        <h2>This is a card</h2>
        <p>This is the content of the card</p>
      </Card>

      <Card card-border>
        <h2>This is a card with a border</h2>
        <p>This is the content of the card</p>
      </Card>

      <Card card-small>
        <h2>This is a small card</h2>
        <p>This is the content of the card</p>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the cards have different styles, depending on the modifier class that is used.

The most important classes to consider are the `card-{variant}` and `card-{size}` classes. These classes will determine the style and size of the card.

No, we don't need to use state to display a card. The card component will automatically be displayed when it is added to the DOM.

However, if you want to control the visibility of the card yourself, you can use the `hidden` prop.

Here is an example of how to use the `hidden` prop:

```
const App = () => {
  const [isCardVisible, setIsCardVisible] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      <Card hidden={!isCardVisible}>
        <h2>This is a card</h2>
        <p>This is the content of the card</p>
      </Card>

      <button onClick={() => setIsCardVisible(!isCardVisible)}>Toggle Card</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the card will be hidden by default. When the user clicks the button, the `setIsCardVisible` function will be called, which will toggle the value of the `isCardVisible` state variable. The card will then be displayed or hidden accordingly.

I hope this helps!

Here are some additional details about the card component:

* The `card-{variant}` modifier classes can be used to change the style of the card. The available variants are `default`, `border`, `hover`, and `active`.
* The `card-{size}` modifier classes can be used to change the size of the card. The available sizes are `small`, `medium`, and `large`.
* The `card` component can also be used to create a carousel. To do this, you need to wrap the `card` elements in a `carousel` component and use the `card-item` component for each card item.

I hope this helps!
