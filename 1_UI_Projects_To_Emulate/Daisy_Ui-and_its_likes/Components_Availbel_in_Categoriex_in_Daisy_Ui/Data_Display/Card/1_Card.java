The `card` component in Daisy UI is used to display information in a structured format. It's often used in user interfaces to group related information in a flexible and extensible container.

Here's a basic example of how to use the `card` component in a Next.js and Tailwind application:

```jsx
<div class="card bordered">
  <figure>
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/1005/400/250">
  </figure> 
  <div class="card-body">
    <h2 class="card-title">Top image</h2> 
    <p>With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.</p> 
    <div class="card-actions">
      <button class="btn btn-primary">Get Started</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, the `card` class is used for the container element, the `card-body` class is used for the card's main content, and the `card-actions` class is used for the container of the card's action buttons.

Here are some classes that you can use with the `card` component:

- `card`: This class is used for the card container element.
- `card-body`: This class is used for the card's main content.
- `card-actions`: This class is used for the container of the card's action buttons.
- `card-title`: This class is used for the card's title.
- `bordered`: This class adds a border to the card.

You typically don't need to use a state variable to display a card, as the card's content can be set directly in the HTML or JSX code. However, you might need to use state if you want to dynamically change the card's content based on user interaction or other events.

Here's an example of how to use state with the `card` component in a Next.js application:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function HomePage() {
  const [cardTitle, setCardTitle] = useState('Top image')

  return (
    <div>
      <div class="card bordered">
        <figure>
          <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/1005/400/250">
        </figure> 
        <div class="card-body">
          <h2 class="card-title">{cardTitle}</h2> 
          <p>With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.</p> 
          <div class="card-actions">
            <button class="btn btn-primary">Get Started</button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <button onClick={() => setCardTitle('New Title')} class="btn">
        Change Title
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, we're using a state variable `cardTitle` to control the title of the card. When the "Change Title" button is clicked, `cardTitle` is set to 'New Title'.

Remember to install Daisy UI and include it in your Tailwind CSS configuration:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'),
  ],
}
```

And then install it via npm:

```bash
npm i daisyui
```
