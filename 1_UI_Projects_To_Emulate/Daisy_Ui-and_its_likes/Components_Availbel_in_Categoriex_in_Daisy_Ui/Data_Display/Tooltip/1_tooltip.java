To use the tooltip component in Daisy UI, you need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Daisy UI
Daisy UI is an extension for Tailwind CSS. You need to install both Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI in your Next.js project. You can do this by adding the required packages to your `package.json` file and running the necessary installations. Here is an example:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss daisyui
```

Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS
After installing the packages, you need to configure Tailwind CSS. In your project, create a `tailwind.config.js` file and add the following code:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'),
  ],
}
```
This configuration enables the use of Daisy UI in your Next.js project.

Step 3: Include the Tooltip Component
To use the tooltip component, you will need to include it in your HTML markup. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```html
<button class="tooltip tooltip-primary">
  Hover over me
  <div class="tooltip-content">
    This is a tooltip
  </div>
</button>
```

In the example above, the tooltip component is denoted by the `tooltip` class. You can change the appearance of the tooltip by applying different variants and styles. The `tooltip-primary` class adds a primary color to the tooltip. You can replace `primary` with other color variants like `secondary`, `accent`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, or `error`, depending on your design requirements.

Step 4: Using Variants

The tooltip component also provides variants to control the position of the tooltip. You can use the following classes to change the position of the tooltip:

- `tooltip-top`: Positions the tooltip above the element.
- `tooltip-bottom`: Positions the tooltip below the element.
- `tooltip-left`: Positions the tooltip to the left of the element.
- `tooltip-right`: Positions the tooltip to the right of the element.

To use these variants, add the appropriate class to your tooltip container element. Here is an example:

```html
<button class="tooltip tooltip-primary tooltip-top">
  Hover over me
  <div class="tooltip-content">
    This is a tooltip
  </div>
</button>
```

In the example above, the `tooltip-top` class is added to position the tooltip above the button element.

Step 5: Managing the Tooltip
Regarding managing the tooltip, Daisy UI handles the visibility of the tooltip automatically. You don't need to manage it using state or explicitly show/hide it. The tooltip appears on hover by default. When the user hovers over the element with the tooltip, the tooltip will be shown, and it will be hidden when the user moves the cursor away.

Here is an example of how you can use the tooltip component with only the hover interaction:

```html
<button class="tooltip">
  Hover over me
  <div class="tooltip-content">
    This is a tooltip
  </div>
</button>
```

In this example, the tooltip will be shown when the user hovers over the button and hidden when they move the cursor away.

Remember to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your Next.js project to ensure the tooltip works correctly.

That's it! You have now learned how to use the tooltip component in Daisy UI, including its different variants and available classes. The tooltip will automatically appear on hover without the need for managing it using state.
