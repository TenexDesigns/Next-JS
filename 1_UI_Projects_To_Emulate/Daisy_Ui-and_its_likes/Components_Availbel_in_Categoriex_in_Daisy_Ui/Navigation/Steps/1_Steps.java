In Daisy UI, the `steps` component is used to create a list of steps in a process, and it provides a visually appealing way to guide users through a multi-step workflow. The `steps` component has various classes and modifiers that allow you to customize its appearance. To manage the state of steps, determine which step is active, and track the progress of the user, you'll typically handle this logic in your Next.js application's code.

Here's how to use the `steps` component in a Next.js and Tailwind CSS application, along with some examples of how to manage step states:

### 1. Basic Steps Component

You can create a basic steps component using Daisy UI's `steps` component like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const StepsComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ul className="steps">
      <li className="step step-primary">Register</li>
      <li className="step step-primary">Choose plan</li>
      <li className="step">Purchase</li>
      <li className="step">Receive Product</li>
    </ul>
  );
};

export default StepsComponent;
```

In this example, we've created a basic steps component with four steps. The first two steps have the `step-primary` modifier, which adds a primary color to them.

### 2. Managing Step State and Progress

To manage the state of steps, determine which step is active, and track the progress of the user, you can use state variables and conditional rendering. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const StepsComponent = () => {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);

  const handleNextStep = () => {
    setCurrentStep(currentStep + 1);
  };

  const handlePreviousStep = () => {
    setCurrentStep(currentStep - 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ul className="steps">
        <li className={`step ${currentStep === 1 ? 'step-primary' : ''}`}>Register</li>
        <li className={`step ${currentStep === 2 ? 'step-primary' : ''}`}>Choose plan</li>
        <li className={`step ${currentStep === 3 ? 'step-primary' : ''}`}>Purchase</li>
        <li className={`step ${currentStep === 4 ? 'step-primary' : ''}`}>Receive Product</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="mt-4">
        {currentStep > 1 && (
          <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={handlePreviousStep}>
            Previous
          </button>
        )}
        {currentStep < 4 && (
          <button className="btn btn-primary ml-2" onClick={handleNextStep}>
            Next
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default StepsComponent;
```

In this example, we've used the `currentStep` state variable to keep track of the active step. The `handleNextStep` and `handlePreviousStep` functions allow the user to navigate through the steps. We conditionally apply the `step-primary` modifier to the step that corresponds to the `currentStep`, making it visually distinct.

This approach allows you to manage the state of steps and track the user's progress through the workflow. You can add more logic based on your specific requirements, such as disabling the "Next" button on the last step or dynamically rendering content for each step.

Remember to adapt the logic to your application's requirements and customize the appearance of the steps and buttons according to your design preferences.
