The code you provided is an example of a footer component in a Next.js and Tailwind CSS application using the Daisy UI library. The footer component is used to display information such as services, company details, and legal information.

Here's an explanation of the code and its different variations:

1. Footer:
   - The footer component is defined with the class "footer" and has additional classes for padding and background color.
   - Inside the footer, there are three "nav" elements, each representing a section of links.
   - Each section has a "header" element with the class "footer-title" to display the section title.
   - The links are represented by "a" elements with the class "link" and "link-hover" for styling.

2. Footer with a logo section:
   - This variation includes an "aside" element before the "nav" elements.
   - Inside the "aside" element, there is an SVG logo and a paragraph with the company name and description.

3. Footer with a form:
   - This variation is similar to the first one but includes a "form" element at the end.
   - Inside the "form" element, there is a "header" element for the newsletter section title.
   - The newsletter form is represented by a "fieldset" element with the class "form-control" and an input field.

To make the footer responsive, you can use Tailwind CSS responsive classes such as "sm:flex" to change the layout on small screens and "text-center" to center-align the content.

Here's an example of a responsive footer using the provided code:

```jsx
<footer className="footer p-10 bg-neutral text-neutral-content">
  <div className="sm:flex">
    <nav className="mb-8 sm:mb-0 sm:mr-8">
      <header className="footer-title">Services</header>
      <a className="link link-hover">Branding</a>
      <a className="link link-hover">Design</a>
      <a className="link link-hover">Marketing</a>
      <a className="link link-hover">Advertisement</a>
    </nav>
    <nav className="mb-8 sm:mb-0 sm:mr-8">
      <header className="footer-title">Company</header>
      <a className="link link-hover">About us</a>
      <a className="link link-hover">Contact</a>
      <a className="link link-hover">Jobs</a>
      <a className="link link-hover">Press kit</a>
    </nav>
    <nav>
      <header className="footer-title">Legal</header>
      <a className="link link-hover">Terms of use</a>
      <a className="link link-hover">Privacy policy</a>
      <a className="link link-hover">Cookie policy</a>
    </nav>
  </div>
</footer>
```

Please note that the responsive layout and styling may vary depending on your specific design requirements.
