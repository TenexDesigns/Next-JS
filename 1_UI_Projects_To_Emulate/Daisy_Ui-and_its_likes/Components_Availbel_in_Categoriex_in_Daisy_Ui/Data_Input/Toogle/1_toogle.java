To use the toggle component in Daisy UI, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Daisy UI
First, you need to install Daisy UI in your Next.js project. You can do this by adding the required package to your `package.json` file and running the necessary installation command. Here's an example using npm:

```bash
npm install daisyui
```

Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS
After installing Daisy UI, you need to configure Tailwind CSS to include the Daisy UI plugin. Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project and add the following code:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'),
  ],
}
```

This configuration enables the use of Daisy UI in your Next.js project.

Step 3: Include the Toggle Component
To use the toggle component, include it in your HTML markup. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```html
<div class="form-control">
  <label class="label">Toggle Button</label>
  <input type="checkbox" class="toggle toggle-primary" />
</div>
```

In the example above, the toggle component is denoted by the `toggle` class. You can customize the appearance of the toggle component by applying different variants and styles. For example, the `toggle-primary` class adds the primary color to the toggle. You can replace `primary` with other color variants like `secondary`, `accent`, `success`, `warning`, `info`, or `error`, depending on your design requirements.

Step 4: Managing State
To manage the state of the toggle component, you can use a combination of JavaScript and React state management.

First, create a state variable to hold the current state of the toggle. For example, using the useState hook from React:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function ToggleComponent() {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);

  const handleToggleChange = () => {
    setChecked(!checked);
  };

  return (
    <div class="form-control">
      <label class="label">Toggle Button</label>
      <input type="checkbox" class="toggle toggle-primary" checked={checked} onChange={handleToggleChange} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the example above, we're using the `useState` hook to define a state variable `checked` and a state update function `setChecked`, initialized with `false`. We're also defining a `handleToggleChange` function to update the state when the checkbox is toggled.

By setting the `checked` prop of the input element to our state variable `checked` and attaching the `onChange` event handler, we can manage the state of the toggle component. The current state of the toggle can be accessed through the `checked` state variable.

Now, whenever the user toggles the checkbox, the `handleToggleChange` function will be triggered, updating the state with the new value. You can use the `checked` state variable in your component to access the current state of the toggle.

Step 5: Retrieve the State Value
To retrieve the value of the toggle component, you can simply access the `checked` state variable in your component. For example, you can display the current state in an alert:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function ToggleComponent() {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);

  const handleToggleChange = () => {
    setChecked(!checked);
  };

  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    alert(`Toggle State: ${checked}`);
  };

  return (
    <div class="form-control">
      <label class="label">Toggle Button</label>
      <input type="checkbox" class="toggle toggle-primary" checked={checked} onChange={handleToggleChange} />
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Get Toggle State</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the example above, we added a button with an `onClick` event handler `handleButtonClick`. When the button is clicked, it will display an alert with the current state of the toggle.

That's it! You have now learned how to use the toggle component in Daisy UI, including its different variants and available classes. You can customize its appearance, including its color. Additionally, you have learned how to manage the state of the toggle component and retrieve its current state in your Next.js and Tailwind CSS application.
