What does timeing for data fetching in Next js 
At build time.
At request time:  
  
This refers to the timing of data fetching in a Next.js component.



  
At build time: 
  When data fetching is performed at build time, it means that the data is fetched and rendered during the build process of your Next.js application.
  This approach is suitable for scenarios where the data is static or doesnt change frequently. 
  The data is fetched once during the build process and then rendered as part of the static HTML generated for the page. 
  When a user visits the page, they receive the pre-rendered content without any additional API requests.

---------
"Build time" refers to the time when your application is being built, typically when you run a command like npm run build or next build. 
  If youre using getStaticProps, the data is fetched at this time, and the HTML is generated based on this data. 
  This HTML is then reused for each request, which can make your page load faster because the server doesnt need to fetch the data 
  and generate the HTML for each request. However, the data is only as fresh as the last time you built your application.
  If the data changes after youve built your application, your page wont reflect these changes until you rebuild your application.



At request time:
    When data fetching is performed at request time, it means that the data is fetched and rendered when a user visits the page or makes a specific request.
    This approach is suitable for scenarios where the data is dynamic or frequently updated. 
    The data is fetched when the page is requested, either on the server or the client side, and then rendered as part of the response. 
    This allows the data to be up-to-date at the time of each request.
--------------------

  "Request time", on the other hand, refers to the time when a user makes a request to your server. 
  If youre using getServerSideProps, the data is fetched at this time, and the HTML is generated based on this data. 
  This means that your page always reflects the most current data, 
  but it can be slower because the server needs to fetch the data and generate the HTML for each request.




In short, getStaticProps (build time) is good for when your data doesnt change often, and you want your page to load quickly.
  getServerSideProps (request time) is good for when your data changes frequently, and you need your page to reflect the most current data. medium.com
