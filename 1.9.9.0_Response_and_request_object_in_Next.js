In Next.js, when using the getServerSideProps function, the context object passed as a parameter provides access to the request and response objects, 
  which represent the HTTP request and response, respectively.
  These objects offer valuable information and functionality that can be utilized in server-side rendering.

In Next.js, the getServerSideProps function is used to fetch data on each request on the server-side.
  This function receives a context object as a parameter, which contains several useful properties including req and res.


req: This is the HTTP IncomingMessage object from Node.js. It includes information about the incoming request, such as headers, request method (GET, POST, etc.), and the request URL.
res: This is the HTTP ServerResponse object from Node.js. Its used to send back the HTTP response to the client.


Here is an example showing how to use req and res in getServerSideProps:

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { req, res } = context;

  console.log(req.headers); // Logs request headers
  console.log(req.method); // Logs request method

  res.statusCode = 200; // Sets the status code of the response
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json'); // Sets the content type of the response

  // Fetch data and return as props
  // ...
}




Request Object (context.req):

    The req object contains information about the incoming HTTP request made by the client.
    It provides access to the request headers, URL, method, cookies, and query parameters.
    Some useful properties and methods of the req object include:
    req.url: The URL of the request.
    req.method: The HTTP method of the request (e.g., GET, POST).
    req.headers: An object containing the request headers.
    req.cookies: An object representing the cookies sent with the request.
    req.query: An object containing the query parameters.

  
Response Object (context.res):

    The res object allows you to control the HTTP response that will be sent back to the client.
    It provides methods for setting response headers, status codes, and cookies.
    Some useful properties and methods of the res object include:
    res.setHeader(name, value): Sets a response header with the specified name and value.
    res.statusCode: The HTTP status code to be sent in the response.
    res.end(): Signals the end of the response and sends it to the client.
    res.redirect(url): Redirects the client to the specified URL.
    res.clearCookie(name): Clears a cookie with the specified name from the response.
    With these request and response objects, you can perform various tasks within the getServerSideProps function, such as:

Accessing request-specific data, such as query parameters or cookies, to fetch dynamic data from APIs or databases.
Setting response headers, status codes, or cookies to customize the behavior of the server response.
Performing server-side redirects based on certain conditions or user authentication status.
Handling error responses or responding with specific error codes.
Its important to note that the request and response objects in Next.js are the same as those used in the Node.js http.IncomingMessage
  and http.ServerResponse objects. You can refer to the Node.js documentation for further details on their properties and methods.

Overall, the request and response objects in the context parameter of getServerSideProps provide valuable functionality for
    working with server-side rendering in Next.js and handling the HTTP requests and responses effectively.

You can use req and res in getServerSideProps for various purposes. For example, you can read cookies from the request, 
      add cookies to the response, check the request method, set the status code of the response, and so on dev.to, refine.dev, plainenglish.io.

Remember that getServerSideProps runs on every request, so use it only when you need to fetch data that changes on each request or depends on the request. 
      If your data can be fetched at build time and doesnt change often, consider using getStaticProps instead for performance benefits nextjs.org.
