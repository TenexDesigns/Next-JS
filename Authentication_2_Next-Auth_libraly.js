NextAuth.js is an open-source lightweight library that provides authentication and authorization support for Next.js applications. It lets developers quickly and easily set up authentication and authorization for their Next.js apps. It provides features such as authentication with multiple providers, email, and passwordless authentication makeuseof.com.

To implement NextAuth.js in your Next.js application, follow these steps:

Step 1: Installation

Create a new Next.js project if you haven't already. You can do this with the following commands:

npx create-next-app my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
Then, install NextAuth.js:

npm i next-auth


Step 2: Configuration

Create a new file under the pages/api/auth directory called [...nextauth].js. This file will be used to configure NextAuth.js. Here's an example configuration:

import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import Providers from 'next-auth/providers'

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Providers.GitHub({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET
    })
  ],
  database: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
})
In this example, GitHub is used as an authentication provider. You can replace it with any other provider supported by NextAuth.js. You also need to provide a database URL for storing session data.



  
Step 3: Environment Variables

Next, you need to provide the environment variables GITHUB_ID, GITHUB_SECRET, and DATABASE_URL. You can do this in a .env.local file in the root of your project:

GITHUB_ID=your_github_id
GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_secret
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
Now, your Next.js application is set up with NextAuth.js. You can use the useSession hook from next-auth/client to access the user's session data in your components:

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Component() {
  const [session, loading] = useSession()

  if (loading) return null

  if (session) {
    return <p>Welcome, {session.user.name}!</p>
  } else {
    return <p>Please sign in</p>
  }
}
In this example, the useSession hook is used to get the current users session. If the user is signed in, their name is displayed. If not, a sign-in prompt is displayed blog.logrocket.com.

To handle sign-in, sign-out, and secure your Next.js application using NextAuth.js, you can use the useSession, signIn, and signOut functions provided by NextAuth.js.

Sign In

You can use the signIn method to start the sign-in process. This method should be called when the user clicks the sign-in button. It redirects the user to the sign-in page and then returns them to the page they started on after they've successfully signed in. Here's how you can use it:

import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react'

export default function SignInButton() {
  return <button onClick={() => signIn()}>Sign in</button>
}
You can also pass additional parameters to the sign-in method. For instance, if youre using the Auth0 provider and want to hint the users email address, you can do this:

signIn('auth0', null, { login_hint: 'info@example.com' })
Sign Out

The signOut method can be used to sign the user out. Similar to the signIn method, it should be called when the user clicks the sign-out button:

import { signOut } from 'next-auth/react'

export default function SignOutButton() {
  return <button onClick={() => signOut()}>Sign out</button>
}
Securing the Application

To secure your application, you can use the useSession hook. This hook returns the user's session if they're signed in, or null if theyre not. You can use this to restrict access to certain parts of your application. For instance, you might have a page that should only be accessible to signed-in users:

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'

export default function ProtectedPage() {
  const { data: session, status } = useSession()
  
  if (status === 'loading') return <p>Loading...</p>
  
  if (status === 'unauthenticated') return <p>Access Denied</p>
  
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Protected Page</h1>
      <p>You can view this page because you are signed in.</p>
    </>
  )
}
In this example, if the session status is loading, a loading message is displayed. If the user is not authenticated, an access denied message is displayed. If the user is authenticated, the contents of the protected page are displayed next-auth.js.org, next-auth.js.org.
